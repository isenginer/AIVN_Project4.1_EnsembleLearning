several methods have been proposed to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset the basic ideal behind all of them has been to study an index that measures intercluster separation and intracluster cohesion over a range of cluster numbers and report the number which gives an optimum value of the index in this paper we propose a simple parameter free approach that is like human cognition to form clusters where closely lying points are easily identified to form a cluster and total number of clusters are revealed to identify closely lying points affinity of two points is defined as a function of distance and a threshold affinity is identified above which two points in a dataset are likely to be in the same cluster well separated clusters are identified even in the presence of outliers whereas for not so well separated dataset final number of clusters are estimated and the detected clusters are merged to produce the final clusters experiments performed with several large dimensional synthetic and real datasets show good results with robustness to noise and density variation within dataset,cs
electromagnetic waves follow linear paths in homogenous index media with the exception of band edges in this study we introduced spatially distorted photonic crystals dpcs that are capable of beamsteering light waves even when a homogeneous refractive index is maintained we analyzed their equifrequency contours to investigate the correspondence between the direction of distortion and the direction of the group velocity vector in the dpc thereafter we experimentally verified the beamsteering phenomenon in the terahertz range using an allsilicon dpc our structures serve as onchip beam trajectory control without the need for any speciallyengineered materials using only lattice distortion,physics
the degree to which gamma ray bursts are collimated is now the dominant uncertainty in their energy requirements and event rates in this review i begin with the reasons for studying grb collimation then discuss existing tests for collimation and their applications to date and finally outline some possible future tests the most important conclusions are that mean collimation angles much tighter than degree appear ruled out the collimation angle appears to vary from burst to burst like most other grb properties some alternative explanations of apparent collimation signatures remain but it should be possible to distinguish them from true collimation with future data sets and may be possible already new satellites improved followup observations and new tests for collimation all promise continued rapid progress in coming years,astro-ph
a scheme of adiabatic crosspolarization is described it is based on demagnetization remagnetization when the zeeman order of abundant nuclei in the laboratory frame is first adiabatically converted into the dipolar order and then into the zeeman order of rare nuclei the scheme implemented with two lowpower frequencysweeping pulses is very efficient for static samples and can significantly increase polarization of rare nuclei compared to the conventional hartmannhahn crosspolarization the experimental examples are presented for solids liquid crystal and molecules in a liquidcrystalline solvent,cond-mat
pure hadronic compact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass central pressure are metastable to the conversion to quark stars hybrid or strange stars in this paper we present a systematic study of the metastability of pure hadronic compact stars using different relativistic models for the equation of state eos in particular we compare results for the quarkmeson coupling qmc model with those for the glendenningmoszkowski parametrization of the nonlinear walecka model nlwm for qmc model we find large values m_cr m_odot for the critical mass of the hadronic star sequence and we find that the formation of a quark star is only possible with a soft quark matter eos for the glendenningmoszkowski parametrization of the nlwm we explore the effect of different hyperon couplings on the critical mass and on the stellar conversion energy we find that increasing the value of the hyperon coupling constants shifts the bulk transition point for quark deconfinement to higher densities increases the stellar metastability threshold mass and the value of the critical mass and thus makes the formation of quark stars less likely for the largest values of the hyperon couplings we find a critical mass which may be as high as m_odot these stellar configurations which contain a large central hyperon fraction f_ycr sim would be able to describe highlymassive compact stars such as the one associated to the millisecond pulsars psr bb with a mass m _ m_odot,astro-ph

recently neural radiance fields nerf is revolutionizing the task of novel view synthesis nvs for its superior performance in this paper we propose to synthesize dynamic scenes extending the methods for static scenes to dynamic scenes is not straightforward as both the scene geometry and appearance change over time especially under monocular setup also the existing dynamic nerf methods generally require a lengthy perscene training procedure where multilayer perceptrons mlp are fitted to model both motions and radiance in this paper built on top of the recent advances in voxelgrid optimization we propose a fast deformable radiance field method to handle dynamic scenes our method consists of two modules the first module adopts a deformation grid to store d dynamic features and a lightweight mlp for decoding the deformation that maps a d point in the observation space to the canonical space using the interpolated features the second module contains a density and a color grid to model the geometry and density of the scene the occlusion is explicitly modeled to further improve the rendering quality experimental results show that our method achieves comparable performance to dnerf using only minutes for training which is more than x faster than dnerf clearly demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed method,cs

carbon dioxide ice clouds are thought to play an important role for cold terrestrial planets with thick co dominated atmospheres various previous studies showed that a scattering greenhouse effect by carbon dioxide ice clouds could result in a massive warming of the planetary surface however all of these studies only employed simplified twostream radiative transfer schemes to describe the anisotropic scattering using accurate radiative transfer models with a general discrete ordinate method this study revisits this important effect and shows that the positive climatic impact of carbon dioxide clouds was strongly overestimated in the past the revised scattering greenhouse effect can have important implications for the early mars but also for planets like the early earth or the position of the outer boundary of the habitable zone,astro-ph
structured light harnessing multiple degrees of freedom has become a powerful approach to use complex states of light in fundamental studies and applications here we investigate the light field of an ultrafast laser beam with a wavelengthdepended polarization state a beam we term spectral vector beam we demonstrate a simple technique to generate and tune such structured beams and demonstrate their spectroscopic capabilities by only measuring the polarization state using fast photodetectors it is possible to track pulsetopulse changes in the frequency spectrum caused by eg narrowband transmission or absorption in our experiments we reach readout rates of around mhz which is limited by our technical ability to modulate the spectrum and can in principle reach ghz readout rates in simulations we extend the spectral range to more than nm by using a supercontinuum light source thereby paving the way to various applications requiring highspeed spectroscopic measurements,physics

an equiangular tight frame etf is a sequence of unitnorm vectors in a euclidean space whose coherence achieves equality in the welch bound and thus yields an optimal packing in a projective space a regular simplex is a simple type of etf in which the number of vectors is one more than the dimension of the underlying space more sophisticated examples include harmonic etfs which equate to difference sets in finite abelian groups recently it was shown that some harmonic etfs are comprised of regular simplices in this paper we continue the investigation into these special harmonic etfs we begin by characterizing when the subspaces that are spanned by the etfs regular simplices form an equiisoclinic tight fusion frame eitff which is a type of optimal packing in a grassmannian space we shall see that every difference set that produces an eitff in this way also yields a complex circulant conference matrix next we consider a subclass of these difference sets that can be factored in terms of a smaller difference set and a relative difference set it turns out that these relative difference sets lend themselves to a second related and yet distinct construction of complex circulant conference matrices finally we provide explicit infinite families of etfs to which this theory applies,math

as documented by textbooks the teaching of electromagnetic induction in university and high school courses is primarily based on what feynman labeled as the flux rule downgrading it from the status of physical law however maxwell derived a general law of electromagnetic induction in which the vector potential plays a fundamental role a modern reformulation of maxwells law can be easily obtained by defining the induced electromotive force as oint_l vec e vec v_ctimes vec bcdotvecdl where vec v_c is the velocity of the positive charges which by convention are the current carriers maxwell did not possess a model for the electric current therefore in his law he took vec v_c to be the velocity of the circuit element containing the charges this paper aims to show that the modern reformulation of maxwells law governs electromagnetic induction and that the flux rule is not a physical law but only a calculation shortcut that does not always yield the correct predictions the paper also tries to understand why maxwells law has been ignored and how the flux rule has taken root finally a section is dedicated to teaching this modern reformulation of maxwells law in high schools and elementary physics courses,physics

accreting steadily nuclearburning white dwarfs are associated with socalled closebinary supersoft xray sources ssss observed to have temperatures of a fewtimes k and luminosities on the order of ergs these and other types of ssss are expected to be capable of ionizing their surrounding circumstellar medium however to date only one such nebula was detected in the large magellanic cloud of its known closebinary ssss surrounding the accreting nuclearburning wd cal this has led to the conclusion that most ssss cannot have been both luminous gtrsim ergs and hot gtrsim few times k for the majority of their past accretion history unless the density of the ism surrounding most sources is much less than that inferred for the cal nebula rmcm here we demonstrate that most ssss must lie in much lower density media than cal past efforts to detect such nebulae have not accounted for the structure of the ism in starforming galaxies and in particular for the fact that most of the volume is occupied by low density warm hot ism cal appears to lie in a region of ism which is at least sim fold overdense we compute the probability of such an event to be approx in good agreement with observed statistics we provide a revised model for the typical sss nebula and outline the requirements of a survey of the magellanic clouds which could detect the majority of such objects we then briefly discuss some of the possible implications should there prove to be a large population of previously undiscovered ionizing sources,astro-ph
retrievalbased language models lms have demonstrated improved interpretability factuality and adaptability compared to their parametric counterparts by incorporating retrieved text from external datastores while it is well known that parametric models are prone to leaking private data it remains unclear how the addition of a retrieval datastore impacts model privacy in this work we present the first study of privacy risks in retrievalbased lms particularly knnlms our goal is to explore the optimal design and training procedure in domains where privacy is of concern aiming to strike a balance between utility and privacy crucially we find that knnlms are more susceptible to leaking private information from their private datastore than parametric models we further explore mitigations of privacy risks when privacy information is targeted and readily detected in the text we find that a simple sanitization step would completely eliminate the risks while decoupling query and key encoders achieves an even better utilityprivacy tradeoff otherwise we consider strategies of mixing public and private data in both datastore and encoder training while these methods offer modest improvements they leave considerable room for future work together our findings provide insights for practitioners to better understand and mitigate privacy risks in retrievalbased lms our code is available at httpsgithubcomprincetonsysmlknnlm_privacy,cs

the lanczos method is one of the standard approaches for computing a few eigenpairs of a large sparse symmetric matrix it is typically used with restarting to avoid unbounded growth of memory and computational requirements thickrestart lanczos is a popular restarted variant because of its simplicity and numerically robustness however convergence can be slow for highly clustered eigenvalues so more effective restarting techniques and the use of preconditioning is needed in this paper we present a thickrestart preconditioned lanczos method trplk that combines the power of locally optimal restarting k and preconditioning techniques with the efficiency of the thickrestart lanczos method trplk employs an innerouter scheme where the inner loop applies lanczos on a preconditioned operator while the outer loop augments the resulting lanczos subspace with certain vectors from the previous restart cycle to obtain eigenvector approximations with which it thick restarts the outer subspace we first identify the differences from various relevant methods in the literature then based on an optimization perspective we show an asymptotic global quasioptimality of a simplified trplk method compared to an unrestarted global optimal method finally we present extensive experiments showing that trplk either outperforms or matches other stateoftheart eigenmethods in both matrixvector multiplications and computational time,math

it is well known by now that the threedimensional nonviscous planetary geostrophic model with vertical hydrostatic balance and horizontal rayleigh friction coupled to the heat diffusion and transport is mathematically illposed this is because the nonormal flow physical boundary condition implicitly produces an additional boundary condition for the temperature at the literal boundary this additional boundary condition is different because of the coriolis forcing term than the no heat flux physical boundary condition consequently the second order parabolic heat equation is over determined with two different boundary conditions in a previous work we proposed one remedy to this problem by introducing a fourthorder artificial hyperdiffusion to the heat transport equation and proved global regularity for the proposed model another remedy for this problem was suggested by r salmon by introducing an additional rayleighlike friction term for the vertical component of the velocity in the hydrostatic balance equation in this paper we prove the global for all time and all initial data wellposedness of strong solutions to the threedimensional salmons planetary geostrophic model of ocean dynamics that is we show global existence uniqueness and continuous dependence of the strong solutions on initial data for this model,math
the binary star par in the orion nebula presents an interesting puzzle in the field of stellar dynamics and evolution binary systems such as par are thought to form from the same natal material and thus the stellar members are expected to have very similar physical attributes however par s stars have significantly different temperatures despite their identical within masses of about solar mass the leading proofofconcept idea is that a third companion gravitationally induced the two stars to orbit closer than their rochelimit which facilitated heating through tidal effects here we expand on this idea and study the threebody dynamical evolution of such a system including tidal and premainsequence evolution we also include tidal heating and mass transfer at the onset of rochelimit crossing we show as a proofofconcept that mass transfer combined with tidal heating can naturally explain the observed temperature discrepancy we also predict the orbital configuration of the possible tertiary companion finally we suggest that the dynamical evolution of such a system has pervasive consequences we expect an abundance of systems to undergo mass transfer during their premainsequence time which can cause temperature differences,astro-ph

in contrast to most other galaxies starformation rates in the milky way can be estimated directly from young stellar objects ysos in the central molecular zone cmz the starformation rate calculated from the number of ysos with microns emission is up to order of magnitude higher than the value estimated from methods based on diffuse emission such as freefree emission whether this effect is real or whether it indicates problems with either or both star formation rate measures is not currently known in this paper we investigate whether estimates based on ysos could be heavily contaminated by more evolved objects such as mainsequence stars we present radiative transfer models of ysos and of mainsequence stars in a constant ambient medium which show that the mainsequence objects can indeed mimic ysos at microns however we show that in some cases the mainsequence models can be marginally resolved at microns whereas the yso models are always unresolved based on the fraction of resolved mips microns sources in the sample of ysos previously used to compute the star formation rate we estimate the fraction of misclassified ysos to be at least which suggests that the starformation rate previously determined from ysos is likely to be at least a factor of three too high,astro-ph

this article is a contribution to the spectral theory of socalled eventually positive operators ie operators t which may not be positive but whose powers tn become positive for large enough n while the spectral theory of such operators is well understood in finite dimensions the infinite dimensional case has received much less attention in the literature we show that several sensible notions of eventual positivity can be defined in the infinite dimensional setting and in contrast to the finite dimensional case those notions do not in general coincide we then prove a variety of typical perronfrobenius type results we show that the spectral radius of an eventually positive operator is contained in the spectrum we give sufficient conditions for the spectral radius to be an eigenvalue admitting a positive eigenvector and we show that the peripheral spectrum of an eventually positive operator is a cyclic set under quite general assumptions all our results are formulated for operators on banach lattices and many of them do not impose any compactness assumptions on the operator,math

solving optimal design problems through crowdsourcing faces a dilemma on one hand human beings have been shown to be more effective than algorithms at searching for good solutions of certain realworld problems with highdimensional or discrete solution spaces on the other hand the cost of setting up crowdsourcing environments the uncertainty in the crowds domainspecific competence and the lack of commitment of the crowd all contribute to the lack of realworld application of design crowdsourcing we are thus motivated to investigate a solutionsearching mechanism where an optimization algorithm is tuned based on human demonstrations on solution searching so that the search can be continued after human participants abandon the problem to do so we model the iterative search process as a bayesian optimization bo algorithm and propose an inverse bo ibo algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimators of the bo parameters based on human solutions we show through a vehicle design and control problem that the search performance of bo can be improved by recovering its parameters based on an effective human search thus ibo has the potential to improve the success rate of design crowdsourcing activities by requiring only good search strategies instead of good solutions from the crowd,cs

micromagnetic simulation results on dynamic hysteresis loops of clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles nps with internal structure composed of nanorods are compared with the widely used macrospin approximation such calculations allowing for nanorodcomposed nps is facilitated by a previously developed coarsegraining method based on the renormalization group approach with a focus on applications to magnetic hyperthermia we show that magnetostatic interactions improve the heating performance of nps in chains and triangles and reduce heating performance in fcc arrangements hysteresis loops of triangular and fcc systems of complex nps are not recovered within the macrospin approximation especially at smaller interparticle distances for triangular arrangements the macrospin approximation predicts that magnetostatic interactions reduce loop area in contrast to the complex np case an investigation of the local hysteresis loops of individual nps and macrospins in clusters reveals the impact of the geometry of their neighbours on individual versus collective magnetic response inhomogenous heating within clusters and further differences between simulating nps with internal structure and the use of the macrospin approximation capturing the internal physical and magnetic structure of nps is thus important for some applications,cond-mat

temporal pulse characterization methods can often not be applied to uv pulses due to the lack of suitable nonlinear crystals and very low pulse energies here a method is introduced for the characterization of two unknown and independent laser pulses the applicability is broad but the method is especially useful for pulses in the deep uv because pulse energies on the picojoulescale suffice the basis is a spectral analysis of the two interfering uv pulses while one of the pulses is phase shifted by an unknown visir pulse via crossphase modulation the pulse retrieval is analytic and the fidelity can be checked by comparing the complexvalued data trace with the retrieved trace,physics

classical first order fo algorithms of convex optimization such as mirror descent algorithm or nesterovs optimal algorithm of smooth convex optimization are well known to have optimal theoretical complexity estimates which do not depend on the problem dimension however to attain the optimality the domain of the problem should admit a good proximal setup the latter essentially means that the problem domain should satisfy certain geometric conditions of favorable geometry and the practical use of these methods is conditioned by our ability to compute at a moderate cost em proximal transformation at each iteration more often than not these two conditions are satisfied in optimization problems arising in computational learning what explains why proximal type fo methods recently became methods of choice when solving various learning problems yet they meet their limits in several important problems such as multitask learning with large number of tasks where the problem domain does not exhibit favorable geometry and learning and matrix completion problems with nuclear norm constraint when the numerical cost of computing proximal transformation becomes prohibitive in largescale problems we propose a novel approach to solving nonsmooth optimization problems arising in learning applications where fencheltype representation of the objective function is available the approach is based on applying fo algorithms to the dual problem and using the em accuracy certificates supplied by the method to recover the primal solution while suboptimal in terms of accuracy guaranties the proposed approach does not rely upon good proximal setup for the primal problem but requires the problem domain to admit a linear optimization oracle the ability to efficiently maximize a linear form on the domain of the primal problem,math

in modern science the efficient numerical treatment of highdimensional problems becomes more and more important a fundamental insight of the theory of informationbased complexity ibc for short is that the computational hardness of a problem can not be described properly only by the rate of convergence there exist problems for which an exponential number of information operations is needed in order to reduce the initial error although there are algorithms which provide an arbitrary large rate of convergence problems that yield this exponential dependence are said to suffer from the curse of dimensionality while analyzing numerical problems it turns out that we can often vanquish this curse by exploiting additional structural properties the aim of this thesis is to present several approaches of this type moreover a detailed introduction to the field of ibc is given,math

it is almost always easier to find an accuratebutcomplex model than an accurateyetsimple model finding optimal sparse accurate models of various forms linear models with integer coefficients decision sets rule lists decision trees is generally nphard we often do not know whether the search for a simpler model will be worthwhile and thus we do not go to the trouble of searching for one in this work we ask an important practical question can accurateyetsimple models be proven to exist or shown likely to exist before explicitly searching for them we hypothesize that there is an important reason that simpleyetaccurate models often do exist this hypothesis is that the size of the rashomon set is often large where the rashomon set is the set of almostequallyaccurate models from a function class if the rashomon set is large it contains numerous accurate models and perhaps at least one of them is the simple model we desire in this work we formally present the rashomon ratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem depending on a function class and a data set the rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space and it is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory insight from studying the rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check whether a simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it namely whether several different machine learning methods achieve similar performance on the data in that sense the rashomon ratio is a powerful tool for understanding why and when an accurateyetsimple model might exist if as we hypothesize in this work many realworld data sets admit large rashomon sets the implications are vast it means that simple or interpretable models may often be used for highstakes decisions without losing accuracy,cs
applying reinforcement learning rl following maximum likelihood estimation mle pretraining is a versatile method for enhancing neural machine translation nmt performance however recent work has argued that the gains produced by rl for nmt are mostly due to promoting tokens that have already received a fairly high probability in pretraining we hypothesize that the large action space is a main obstacle to rls effectiveness in mt and conduct two sets of experiments that lend support to our hypothesis first we find that reducing the size of the vocabulary improves rls effectiveness second we find that effectively reducing the dimension of the action space without changing the vocabulary also yields notable improvement as evaluated by bleu semantic similarity and human evaluation indeed by initializing the networks final fully connected layer that maps the networks internal dimension to the vocabulary dimension with a layer that generalizes over similar actions we obtain a substantial improvement in rl performance bleu points on average,cs

speed of state transitions in macroscopic systems is a crucial concept for foundations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as various applications in quantum technology represented by optimal quantum control while extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical processes since mandelstam and tamm speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions have remained elusive here by employing the local conservation law of probability the fundamental principle in physics we develop a general framework for deriving qualitatively tighter speed limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional ones we show for the first time that the speed of the expectation value of an observable defined on an arbitrary graph which can describe general manybody systems is bounded by the gradient of the observable in contrast with conventional speed limits depending on the entire range of the observable this framework enables us to derive novel quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics unlike previous bounds the speed limit decreases when the expectation value of the transition hamiltonian increases this intuitively describes a new tradeoff relation between time and quantum phase difference our bound is dependent on instantaneous quantum states and thus can achieve the equality condition which is conceptually distinct from the liebrobinson bound our work elucidates novel speed limits on the basis of local conservation law providing fundamental limits to various types of nonequilibrium quantum macroscopic phenomena,cond-mat

wear is well known for causing material loss in a sliding interface available macroscopic approaches are bound to empirical fitting parameters which range several orders of magnitude major advances in tribology have recently been achieved via molecular dynamics although its use is strongly limited by computational cost here we propose a study of the physical processes that lead to wear at the scale of the surface roughness where adhesive junctions are formed between the asperities on the surface of the materials using a brittle formulation of the variational phasefield approach to fracture we demonstrate that the failure mechanisms of an adhesive junction can be linked to its geometry by imposing specific couplings between the damage and the elastic energy we further investigate the triggering processes underlying each failure mechanism we show that a large debris formation is mostly triggered by tensile stresses while shear stresses lead to small or no particle formation we also study groups of junctions and discuss how microcontact interactions can be favored in some geometries to form macroparticles this leads us to propose a classification in terms of macroscopic wear rate although based on a continuum approach our phasefield calculations are able to effectively capture the failure of adhesive junctions as observed through discrete molecular dynamics simulations,cs

we describe the application of a statistical method to estimate submillimeter galaxy number counts from confusion limited observations by the balloonborne large aperture submillimeter telescope blast our method is based on a maximum likelihood fit to the pixel histogram sometimes called pd an approach which has been used before to probe faint counts the difference being that here we advocate its use even for sources with relatively high signaltonoise ratios this method has an advantage over standard techniques of source extraction in providing an unbiased estimate of the counts from the bright end down to flux densities well below the confusion limit we specifically analyse blast observations of a roughly sq deg map centered on the great observatories origins deep survey south goodss field we provide estimates of number counts at the three blast wavelengths and microns instead of counting sources in flux bins we estimate the counts at several flux density nodes connected with powerlaws we observe a generally very steep slope for the counts of about at microns and at and microns over the range jy breaking to a shallower slope below about jy at all three wavelengths we also describe how to estimate the uncertainties and correlations in this method so that the results can be used for modelfitting this method should be wellsuited for analysis of data from the herschel satellite,astro-ph

in realworld our dna is unique but many people share names this phenomenon often causes erroneous aggregation of documents of multiple persons who are namesake of one another such mistakes deteriorate the performance of document retrieval web search and more seriously cause improper attribution of credit or blame in digital forensic to resolve this issue the name disambiguation task is designed which aims to partition the documents associated with a name reference such that each partition contains documents pertaining to a unique reallife person existing solutions to this task substantially rely on feature engineering such as biographical feature extraction or construction of auxiliary features from wikipedia however for many scenarios such features may be costly to obtain or unavailable due to the risk of privacy violation in this work we propose a novel name disambiguation method our proposed method is nonintrusive of privacy because instead of using attributes pertaining to a reallife person our method leverages only relational data in the form of anonymized graphs in the methodological aspect the proposed method uses a novel representation learning model to embed each document in a low dimensional vector space where name disambiguation can be solved by a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly better than the existing name disambiguation methods working in a similar setting,cs

since its invention in the adam optimizer has received tremendous attention on one hand it has been widely used in deep learning and many variants have been proposed while on the other hand their theoretical convergence property remains to be a mystery it is far from satisfactory in the sense that some studies require strong assumptions about the updates which are not necessarily applicable in practice while other studies still follow the original problematic convergence analysis of adam which was shown to be not sufficient to ensure convergence although rigorous convergence analysis exists for adam they impose specific requirements on the update of the adaptive step size which are not generic enough to cover many other variants of adam to address theses issues in this extended abstract we present a simple and generic proof of convergence for a family of adamstyle methods including adam amsgrad adabound etc our analysis only requires an increasing or large momentum parameter for the firstorder moment which is indeed the case used in practice and a boundness condition on the adaptive factor of the step size which applies to all variants of adam under mild conditions of stochastic gradients we also establish a variance diminishing result for the used stochastic gradient estimators indeed our analysis of adam is so simple and generic that it can be leveraged to establish the convergence for solving a broader family of nonconvex optimization problems including minmax compositional and bilevel optimization problems for the full earlier version of this extended abstract please refer to arxiv,cs
this paper describes heavytailed extensions of a stateoftheart versatile blind source separation method called fast multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization fastmnmf from a unified point of view the common way of deriving such an extension is to replace the multivariate complex gaussian distribution in the likelihood function with its heavytailed generalization eg the multivariate complex students t and leptokurtic generalized gaussian distributions and tailormake the corresponding parameter optimization algorithm using a wider class of heavytailed distributions called a gaussian scale mixture gsm ie a mixture of gaussian distributions whose variances are perturbed by positive random scalars called impulse variables we propose gsmfastmnmf and develop an expectationmaximization algorithm that works even when the probability density function of the impulse variables have no analytical expressions we show that existing heavytailed fastmnmf extensions are instances of gsmfastmnmf and derive a new instance based on the generalized hyperbolic distribution that include the normalinverse gaussian students t and gaussian distributions as the special cases our experiments show that the normalinverse gaussian fastmnmf outperforms the stateoftheart fastmnmf extensions and ilrma model in speech enhancement and separation in terms of the signaltodistortion ratio,cs

confocal microscopy is an essential imaging tool for biological systems in solidstate physics and nanophotonics using confocal microscopes allows performing resonant fluorescence experiments where the emitted light has the same wavelength as the excitation laser theses challenging experiments are carried out under linear crosspolarization conditions rejecting laser light from the detector in this work we uncover the physical mechanisms that are at the origin of the yet unexplained high polarization rejection ratio which makes these measurements possible we show in both experiment and theory that the use of a reflecting surface ie the beamsplitter and mirrors placed between the polarizer and analyzer in combination with a confocal arrangement explains the giant crosspolarization extinction ratio of and beyond we map the modal transformation of the polarized optical gaussian beam we find an intensity hole in the reflected beam under crosspolarization conditions we interpret this as a manifestation of the imbertfedorov effect which deviates the beam depending on its polarization helicity this implies that this topological effect is amplified here from the usually observed nanometer to the micrometer scale due to our crosspolarization dark field methods we confirm these experimental findings for a large variety of commercially available mirrors and polarization components allowing their practical implementation in many experiments,physics

robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades one of the central challenges of manipulation is partial observability as the agent usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the objects it is manipulating in advance a recently emerging theory that deals with partial observability in an explicit manner is active inference it does so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goaldirected but also informative about the environment in this work we apply active inference to a hardtoexplore simulated robotic manipulation tasks in which the agent has to balance a ball into a target zone since the reward of this task is sparse in order to explore this environment the agent has to learn to balance the ball without any extrinsic feedback purely driven by its own curiosity we show that the informationseeking behavior induced by active inference allows the agent to explore these challenging sparse environments systematically finally we conclude that using an informationseeking objective is beneficial in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods that do not exhibit directed exploration fail,cs

the coming into light of the neutron is discussed it is remarked that some experiments had already suggested that the penetrating radiation from beryllium had an electromagnetic component before joliotcuries suggested the beryllium radiation consisted of highenergy gamma rays joliotcuries idea also relied on the many compton electron tracks in the wilson chamber in both harkins and rutherford foresaw the existence of a particle of mass and zero charge consisting of one proton and one electron though they did not give any name to it in the neutron was finally observed by chadwick however the question whether considering the neutron as a fundamental or a compound particle still bothered the physicists and chadwick himself for more than one year instead as soon as majorana heard about joliotcuries experiments he guessed the existence of a neutral proton in he published some corrections to heisenbergs theory a very simple analysis shows that heisenbergs original version of exchange interactions and majoranas version clearly reflect respectively that the nucleus contained electrons and that the nucleus was free from electrons the emission of electrons from the nucleus still needed to be accounted for fermis theory of betadecay settled the question thanks to exchange interactions and betadecay theory quantum mechanics could now be applied to the nucleus which could be considered free from electrons also the neutron could be considered free from electrons and treated as a fundamental particle,physics
a central quest in explainable ai relates to understanding the decisions made by learned classifiers there are three dimensions of this understanding that have been receiving significant attention in recent years the first dimension relates to characterizing conditions on instances that are necessary and sufficient for decisions therefore providing abstractions of instances that can be viewed as the reasons behind decisions the next dimension relates to characterizing minimal conditions that are sufficient for a decision therefore identifying maximal aspects of the instance that are irrelevant to the decision the last dimension relates to characterizing minimal conditions that are necessary for a decision therefore identifying minimal perturbations to the instance that yield alternate decisions we discuss in this tutorial a comprehensive semantical and computational theory of explainability along these dimensions which is based on some recent developments in symbolic logic the tutorial will also discuss how this theory is particularly applicable to nonsymbolic classifiers such as those based on bayesian networks decision trees random forests and some types of neural networks,cs

magnetic field data provided by the helioseismic and magnetic imager on board the solar dynamics observatory were utilized to explore the changes in the magnetic energy of four active regions ars during their emergence we found that at the very early stage of the magnetic flux emergence an abrupt steepening of the magnetic power spectrum takes place leading to rapid increase of the absolute value of the negative spectra power index alpha in ek sim kalpha as the emergence proceeds the energy increases at all scales simultaneously implying that elements of all sizes do appear in the photosphere meanwhile the energy gain at scales larger than approx mm prevails as compared to that at smaller scales both direct ie fragmentation of large structures into smaller ones and inverse ie merging of small magnetic features into larger elements cascades are readily observed during the emergence however in the case of inverse cascade the total energy gained at large scales exceeds the energy loss at smaller scales assuming simultaneous appearance of largescale magnetic entities from beneath the photosphere we conclude that most of the time the energy may grow at all scales we also cannot support the point of view regarding the dominant role of the inverse cascade in the formation of an ar although the coalescence of small magnetic elements into larger pores and sunspots is observed our analysis shows that the prevailed energy contribution to an ar comes from emergence of largescale structures,astro-ph

the partial calmness for the bilevel programming problem blpp is an important condition which ensures that a local optimal solution of blpp is a local optimal solution of a partially penalized problem where the lower level optimality constraint is moved to the objective function and hence a weaker constraint qualification can be applied in this paper we propose a sufficient condition in the form of a partial error bound condition which guarantees the partial calmness condition we analyse the partial calmness for the combined program based on the bouligand b and the fritz john fj stationary conditions from a generic point of view our main result states that the partial error bound condition for the combined programs based on b and fj conditions are generic for an important setting with applications in economics and hence the partial calmness for the combined program is not a particularly stringent assumption moreover we derive optimality conditions for the combined program for the generic case without any extra constraint qualifications and show the exact equivalence between our optimality condition and the one by jongen and shikhman given in implicit form our arguments are based on jongen jonker and twilts generic five type classification of the socalled generalized critical points for onedimensional parametric optimization problems and jongen and shikhmans generic local reductions of blpps,math

grid entropy is a deterministic quantity inherent to lattice models which captures the entropy of empirical measures along paths that converge weakly to a given target measure in this paper we study the limiting behaviour of empirical measures in a model consisting of repeatedly taking d samples from a distribution and picking out one according to an omniscient strategy we show that the set of limit points of empirical measures is almost surely the same whether or not we restrict ourselves to strategies which make the choices independently of all past and future choices and furthermore that this set coincides with the set of measures with finite grid entropy this set is convex and weakly compact we characterize its extreme points as those given by a natural greedy deterministic strategy and we compute the grid entropy of said extreme points to be this yields a description of the set of limit points of empirical measures as the closed convex hull of measures given by a density which is d cdot betad distributed we also derive a simplified version of a grid entropybased variational formula for gibbs free energy for this model and we present the dual formula for grid entropy,math

sessionbased recommendation is a challenging problem in the realworld scenes eg ecommerce short video platforms and music platforms which aims to predict the next click action based on the anonymous session recently graph neural networks gnns have emerged as the stateoftheart methods for sessionbased recommendation however we find that there exist two limitations in these methods one is the item transition relations are not fully exploited since the relations are not explicitly modeled another is the longrange dependencies between items can not be captured effectively due to the limitation of gnns to solve the above problems we propose a novel approach for sessionbased recommendation called transition relation aware selfattention trasa specifically trasa first converts the session to a graph and then encodes the shortest path between items through the gated recurrent unit as their transition relation then to capture the longrange dependencies trasa utilizes the selfattention mechanism to build the direct connection between any two items without going through intermediate ones also the transition relations are incorporated explicitly when computing the attention scores extensive experiments on three realword datasets demonstrate that trasa outperforms the existing stateoftheart methods consistently,cs
in the coming era of exascale supercomputing insitu visualization will be a crucial approach for reducing the output data size a problem of insitu visualization is that it loses interactivity if a steering method is not adopted in this paper we propose a new method for the interactive analysis of insitu visualization images produced by a batch simulation job a key idea is to apply numerous thousands to millions insitu visualizations simultaneously the viewer then analyzes the image database interactively during postprocessing if each movie can be compressed to mb one million movies will only require tb which is smaller than the size of the raw numerical data in exascale supercomputing we performed a feasibility study using the proposed method multiple movie files were produced by a simulation and they were analyzed using a specially designed movie player the user could change the viewing angle the visualization method and the parameters interactively by retrieving an appropriate sequence of images from the movie dataset,physics
exploring statistics of locally connected subgraph patterns also known as network motifs has helped researchers better understand the structure and function of biological and online social networks osns nowadays the massive size of some critical networks often stored in already overloaded relational databases effectively limits the rate at which nodes and edges can be explored making it a challenge to accurately discover subgraph statistics in this work we propose sampling methods to accurately estimate subgraph statistics from as few queried nodes as possible we present sampling algorithms that efficiently and accurately estimate subgraph properties of massive networks our algorithms require no precomputation or complete network topology information at the same time we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence we perform experiments using widely known data sets and show that for the same accuracy our algorithms require an order of magnitude less queries samples than the current stateoftheart algorithms,cs
humanai complementarity is important when neither the algorithm nor the human yields dominant performance across all instances in a given context recent work that explored humanai collaboration has considered decisions that correspond to classification tasks however in many important contexts where humans can benefit from ai complementarity humans undertake course of action in this paper we propose a framework for a novel humanai collaboration for selecting advantageous course of action which we refer to as learning complementary policy for humanai teams textsclcphai our solution aims to exploit the humanai complementarity to maximize decision rewards by learning both an algorithmic policy that aims to complement humans by a routing model that defers decisions to either a human or the ai to leverage the resulting complementarity we then extend our approach to leverage opportunities and mitigate risks that arise in important contexts in practice when a team is composed of multiple humans with differential and potentially complementary abilities when the observational data includes consistent deterministic actions and when the covariate distribution of future decisions differ from that in the historical data we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods using data on real human responses and semisynthetic and find that our methods offer reliable and advantageous performance across setting and that it is superior to when either the algorithm or the ai make decisions on their own we also find that the extensions we propose effectively improve the robustness of the humanai collaboration performance in the presence of different challenging settings,cs

we implement adaptive mesh refinement amr simulations of global topological strings using the public numerical relativity code grchombo we perform a quantitative investigation of the dynamics of single sinusoidally displaced string configurations studying a wide range of string energy densities mu propto lnlambda defined by the string width parameter lambda over two orders of magnitude we investigate the resulting massless goldstone boson or axion radiation signals using quantitative diagnostic tools to determine the eigenmode decomposition given analytic radiation predictions we compare the oscillating string trajectory with a backreaction model accounting for radiation energy losses finding excellent agreement we establish that backreaction decay is accurately characterised by the inverse square of the amplitude being proportional to the inverse tension mu for lesssim lambda lesssim we conclude that analytic radiation modelling in the thinstring nambugoto limit provides the appropriate cosmological limit for global strings we contextualise these results with respect to axions and gravitational waves produced by cosmic string networks,astro-ph
what are the structural determinants of protein sequence evolution a number of sitespecific structural characteristics have been proposed most of which are broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent accessibility of individual residues most importantly there has been disagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent accessibility and local packing density for explaining sitespecific sequence variability in proteins we show here that this discussion has been confounded by the definition of local packing density the most commonly used measures of local packing such as the contact number and the weighted contact number represent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and longerrange effects as an alternative we here propose a truly local measure of packing density around a single residue based on the voronoi cell volume we show that the voronoi cell volume when calculated relative to the geometric center of aminoacid side chains behaves nearly identically to the relative solvent accessibility and both can explain on average approximately of the sitespecific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of enzymes an additional of variation can be explained by nonlocal effects that are captured in the weighted contact number consequently evolutionary variation at a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate aminoacid neighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids we conclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing density future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate contacts and longerrange effects on evolutionary variation,physics

the modulus of a rigid network of harmonic springs depends on the sum of the energies in each of the bonds due to the applied distortion compression in the case of the bulk modulus b or shear in the case of the shear modulus mathcalg the distortion need not be global and we introduce a local modulus l_i associated with changing the equilibrium length of a single bond i in the network we show that l_i is useful for understanding many aspects of the mechanical response of the entire system for example it allows an understanding and efficient computation of how each bond in a network contributes to global properties such as b and mathcalg and sheds light on how a particular bonds contribution to one modulus is or is not correlated with its contribution to another,cond-mat

the huge size of the widely used bert family models has led to recent efforts about model distillation the main goal of distillation is to create a taskagnostic pretrained model that can be finetuned on downstream tasks without finetuning its fullsized version despite the progress of distillation to what degree and for what reason a taskagnostic model can be created from distillation has not been well studied also the mechanisms behind transfer learning of those bert models are not well investigated either therefore this work focuses on analyzing the acceptable deduction when distillation for guiding the future distillation procedure specifically we first inspect the prunability of the transformer heads in roberta and albert using their head importance estimation proposed by michel et al and then check the coherence of the important heads between the pretrained task and downstream tasks hence the acceptable deduction of performance on the pretrained task when distilling a model can be derived from the results and we further compare the behavior of the pruned model before and after finetuning our studies provide guidance for future directions about bert family model distillation,cs

finding an accurate stressstrain relation able to describe the mechanical behavior of metals during forming and machining processes is an important challenge in several fields of mechanics with significant repercussions in the technological field indeed in order to predict the real mechanical behavior of materials constitutive laws must be able to take into account elastic viscous and plastic phenomena most constitutive models are based on empirical evidence andor theoretical approaches and provide a good prediction of the mechanical behavior of several materials here we present a non linear stressstrain relation based on fractional operators the proposed constitutive law is based on integral formulation and takes into account the viscoelastic behavior of the material and the inelastic phenomenon that appears when the stress reaches a particular yielding value a specific case of the proposed constitutive law for imposed strain history is used to fit experimental data obtained from tensile tests on two kind of metal alloys a bestfitting procedure demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed stressstrain relation and its results are compared to those obtained with some classical models we conclude that the proposed model provides the best results in predicting the mechanical behavior for low and high values of stressstrain,cond-mat

knowledge distillation is typically conducted by training a small model the student to mimic a large and cumbersome model the teacher the idea is to compress the knowledge from the teacher by using its output probabilities as softlabels to optimize the student however when the teacher is considerably large there is no guarantee that the internal knowledge of the teacher will be transferred into the student even if the student closely matches the softlabels its internal representations may be considerably different this internal mismatch can undermine the generalization capabilities originally intended to be transferred from the teacher to the student in this paper we propose to distill the internal representations of a large model such as bert into a simplified version of it we formulate two ways to distill such representations and various algorithms to conduct the distillation we experiment with datasets from the glue benchmark and consistently show that adding knowledge distillation from internal representations is a more powerful method than only using softlabel distillation,cs

the detection of communities in graph datasets provides insight about a graphs underlying structure and is an important tool for various domains such as social sciences marketing traffic forecast and drug discovery while most existing algorithms provide fast approaches for community detection their results usually contain strictly separated communities however most datasets would semantically allow for or even require overlapping communities that can only be determined at much higher computational cost we build on an efficient algorithm fox that detects such overlapping communities fox measures the closeness of a node to a community by approximating the count of triangles which that node forms with that community we propose lazyfox a multithreaded version of the fox algorithm which provides even faster detection without an impact on community quality this allows for the analyses of significantly larger and more complex datasets lazyfox enables overlapping community detection on complex graph datasets with millions of nodes and billions of edges in days instead of weeks as part of this work lazyfoxs implementation was published and is available as a tool under an mit licence at httpsgithubcomtimgarrelslazyfox,cs
we study the response of a conical metallic surface to an external electromagnetic em field by representing the fields in basis functions containing integrable singularities at the tip of the cone a fast analytical solution is obtained by the conformal mapping between the cone and a round disk we apply our calculation to the scattering based scanning nearfield optical microscope ssnom and successfully quantify the elastic light scattering from a vibrating metallic tip over a uniform sample we find that the fieldinduced charge distribution consists of localized terms at the tip and the base and an extended bulk term along the body of the cone far away from the tip in recent ssnom experiments at the visibleir range nm mu m the fundamental is found to be much larger than the higher harmonics whereas at thz range mu mmm the fundamental becomes comparable to the higher harmonics we find that the localized tip charge dominates the contribution to the higher harmonics and becomes bigger for the thz experiments thus providing an intuitive understanding of the origin of the nearfield signals we demonstrate the application of our method by extracting a twodimensional effective dielectric constant map from the ssnom image of a finite metallic disk where the variation comes from the charge density induced by the em field,cond-mat

giry algebras are barycenters maps which are coequalizers of contractible coequalizer pairs like any algebras and their existence in general requires the measurable space be coseparated by the discrete two point space and the hypothesis that no measurable cardinals exist under that hypothesis every measurable space which is coseparated has an algebra and the category of giry algebras provides a convenient setting for probability theory because it is a symmetric monoidal closed category with all limits and colimits as well as having a seperator and coseperator this is in stark contrast to the kleisi category of the giry monad which is often used to model conditional probability which has a seperator but not much else,math

when quantizing neural networks for efficient inference lowbit integers are the goto format for efficiency however lowbit floating point numbers have an extra degree of freedom assigning some bits to work on an exponential scale instead this paper indepth investigates this benefit of the floating point format for neural network inference we detail the choices that can be made for the fp format including the important choice of the number of bits for the mantissa and exponent and show analytically in which settings these choices give better performance then we show how these findings translate to real networks provide an efficient implementation for fp simulation and a new algorithm that enables the learning of both the scale parameters and the number of exponent bits in the fp format our chief conclusion is that when doing posttraining quantization for a wide range of networks the fp format is better than int in terms of accuracy and the choice of the number of exponent bits is driven by the severity of outliers in the network we also conduct experiments with quantizationaware training where the difference in formats disappears as the network is trained to reduce the effect of outliers,cs

we present the result of a systematic infrared um spectroscopic study of nearby infrared galaxies over a wide infrared luminosity range logl_ir lsun obtained from akari infrared camera irc the unique band of the akari irc spectroscopy enables us to access both the um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah emission feature from star forming activity and the continuum of torusdust emission heated by an active galactic nucleus agn applying our agn diagnostics to the akari spectra we discover buried agns the large fraction of buried agns suggests that agn activity behind the dust is almost ubiquitous in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ulirgs we also find that both the fraction and energy contribution of buried agns increase with infrared luminosity from logl_ir lsun including normal infrared galaxies with log l_ir lsun the energy contribution from agns in the total infrared luminosity is only in lirgs and in ulirgs suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosity originates from starburst activity using the pah emission we investigate the luminosity relation between star formation and agn we find that these infrared galaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected seyfert galaxies with the same agn luminosities implying that infrared galaxies could be an early evolutionary phase of agn,astro-ph

as machine learning ml classifiers increasingly oversee the automated monitoring of network traffic studying their resilience against adversarial attacks becomes critical this paper focuses on poisoning attacks specifically backdoor attacks against network traffic flow classifiers we investigate the challenging scenario of cleanlabel poisoning where the adversarys capabilities are constrained to tampering only with the training data without the ability to arbitrarily modify the training labels or any other component of the training process we describe a trigger crafting strategy that leverages model interpretability techniques to generate trigger patterns that are effective even at very low poisoning rates finally we design novel strategies to generate stealthy triggers including an approach based on generative bayesian network models with the goal of minimizing the conspicuousness of the trigger and thus making detection of an ongoing poisoning campaign more challenging our findings provide significant insights into the feasibility of poisoning attacks on network traffic classifiers used in multiple scenarios including detecting malicious communication and application classification,cs
a decrease of fracture toughness of irradiated materials is usually observed as reported for austenitic stainless steels in light water reactors lwrs or copper alloys for fusion applications for a wide range of applications eg structural steels irradiated at low homologous temperature void growth and coalescence fracture mechanism has been shown to be still predominant as a consequence a comprehensive study of the effects of irradiationinduced hardening mechanisms on void growth and coalescence in irradiated materials is required the effects of irradiation on ductile fracture mechanisms void growth to coalescence are assessed in this study based on model experiments pure copper thin tensile samples have been irradiated with protons up to dpa micronscale holes drilled through the thickness of these samples subjected to uniaxial loading conditions allow a detailed description of void growth and coalescence in this study experimental data show that physical mechanisms of micronscale void growth and coalescence are similar between the unirradiated and irradiated copper however an acceleration of void growth is observed in the later case resulting in earlier coalescence which is consistent with the decrease of fracture toughness reported in irradiated materials these results are qualitatively reproduced with numerical simulations accounting for irradiation macroscopic hardening and decrease of strainhardening capability,cond-mat

any model order reduced dynamical system that evolves a modal decomposition to approximate the discretized solution of a stochastic pde can be related to a vector field tangent to the manifold of fixed rank matrices the dynamically orthogonal do approximation is the canonical reduced order model for which the corresponding vector field is the orthogonal projection of the original system dynamics onto the tangent spaces of this manifold the embedded geometry of the fixed rank matrix manifold is thoroughly analyzed the curvature of the manifold is characterized and related to the smallest singular value through the study of the weingarten map differentiability results for the orthogonal projection onto embedded manifolds are reviewed and used to derive an explicit dynamical system for tracking the truncated singular value decomposition svd of a timedependent matrix it is demonstrated that the error made by the do approximation remains controlled under the minimal condition that the original solution stays close to the low rank manifold which translates into an explicit dependence of this error on the gap between singular values the do approximation is also justified as the dynamical system that applies instantaneously the svd truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the reduced solution riemannian matrix optimization is investigated in this extrinsic framework to provide algorithms that adaptively update the best low rank approximation of a smoothly varying matrix the related gradient flow provides a dynamical system that converges to the truncated svd of an input matrix for almost every initial data,math

we present multiwavelength observations of a prominence eruption originating from a quadrupolar field configuration in which the prominence was embedded in a sidearcade within the twoday period prior to its eruption on october the prominence was perturbed three times by chromospheric fibrils underneath which rose upward became brightened and merged into the prominence resulting in horizontal flows along the prominence axis suggesting that the fluxes carried by the fibrils were incorporated into the magnetic field of the prominence these perturbations caused the prominence to oscillate and to rise faster than before the absence of intense heating within the first two hours after the onset of the prominence eruption which followed an exponential increase in height indicates that ideal instability played a crucial role the eruption involved interactions with the other sidearcade leading up to a twin coronal mass ejection which was accompanied by transient surface brightenings in the central arcade followed by transient dimmings and brightenings in the two sidearcades we suggest that flux feeding from chromospheric fibrils might be an important mechanism to trigger coronal eruptions,astro-ph

field emission data are often represented on a fowlernordheim plot but a new empirical equation has been recently proposed to better analyze experiments such an equation is based on approximations of the murphy and good model and predicts that a constant parameter kappa depending only on the work function of the emitter can be extracted from the data we compared this empirical equation with simulations of the murphy and good model in order to determine the range of validity of the approximations and the robustness of the relationship between kappa and the work function we found that kappa is constant only over a limited range of electric fields and so depends significantly on the field enhancement factor this result calls into question the usefulness of the new empirical equation,cond-mat

the most widelystudied mechanism of mass loss from extrasolar planets is photoevaporation via xuv ionization primarily in the context of highly irradiated planets however the euv dissociation of hydrogen molecules can also theoretically drive atmospheric evaporation on lowmass planets for temperate planets such as the early earth impact erosion is expected to dominate in the traditional planetesimal accretion model but it would be greatly reduced in pebble accretion scenarios allowing other mass loss processes to be major contributors we apply the same prescription for photoionization to this photodissociation mechanism and compare it to an analysis of other possible sources of mass loss in pebble accretion scenarios we find that there is not a clear path to evaporating the primordial atmosphere accreted by an early earth analog in a pebble accretion scenario impact erosion could remove bars of hydrogen if of the planets mass is accreted as planetesimals while the combined photoevaporation processes could evaporate bars of hydrogen photodissociation is likely a subdominant but significant component of mass loss similar results apply to superearths and minineptunes this mechanism could also preferentially remove hydrogen from a planets primordial atmosphere thereby leaving a larger abundance of primordial water compared to standard dry formation models we discuss the implications of these results for models of rocky planet formation including earths formation and the possible application of this analysis to mass loss from observed exoplanets,astro-ph

the theory of transition between alphahelix betasheet and random coil conformation of a protein is discussed through a simple model that includes both short and longrange interactions besides the bonding parameter and helical initiation factor in zimmbragg model three new parameters are introduced to describe beta structure the local constraint factor for a single residue to be contained in a betastrand the longrange bonding parameter that accounts for the interaction between a pair of bonded betastrands and a correction factor for the initiation of a betasheet either increasing local constraint factor or longrange bonding parameter can cause a transition from alphahelix or random coil conformation to betasheet conformation the sharpness of transition depends on the competition between short and longrange interactions other effective factors such as the chain length and temperature are also discussed in this model the entropy due to different ways to group betastrands into different betasheets gives rise to significant contribution to partition function and makes major differences between beta structure and helical structure,physics
in this article we present a nanoelectromechanical system nems designed to detect changes in the casimir energy the casimir effect is a result of the appearance of quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic vacuum previous experiments have used nano or micro scale parallel plate capacitors to detect the casimir force by measuring the small attractive force these fluctuations exert between the two surfaces in this new set of experiments we aim to directly detect shifts in the casimir textitenergy in the vacuum due to the presence of metallic parallel plates one of which is a superconductor a change in the casimir energy of this configuration is predicted to shift the superconducting transition temperature t_textrmc because of an interaction between it and the superconducting condensation energy the experiment we discuss consists of taking a superconducting film carefully measuring its transition temperature bringing a conducting plate close to the film creating a casimir cavity and then measuring the transition temperature again the expected shifts will be small comparable to the normal shifts one sees in cycling superconducting films to cryogenic temperatures and so using a nems resonator and doing this in situ is the only practical way to obtain accurate reproducible data using a thin pb film and opposing au surface we observe no shift in t_textrmc greater than muk down to a minimum spacing of approximately nm,physics

current approaches to ab testing in networks focus on limiting interference the concern that treatment effects can spill over from treatment nodes to control nodes and lead to biased causal effect estimation prominent methods for network experiment design rely on twostage randomization in which sparselyconnected clusters are identified and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control here we show that cluster randomization does not ensure sufficient node randomization and it can lead to selection bias in which treatment and control nodes represent different populations of users to address this problem we propose a principled framework for network experiment design which jointly minimizes interference and selection bias we introduce the concepts of edge spillover probability and cluster matching and demonstrate their importance for designing network ab testing our experiments on a number of realworld datasets show that our proposed framework leads to significantly lower error in causal effect estimation than existing solutions,cs
we present model light curves for accreting black hole candidates bhc based on a recently proposed model for their spectrotemporal properties according to this model the observed light curves and aperiodic variability of bhc are due to a series of soft photon injections at random poisson intervals near the compact object and their reprocessing into hard radiation in an extended but nonuniform hot plasma corona surrounding the compact object we argue that the majority of the timing characteristics of these light curves are due to the stochastic nature of the comptonization process in the extended corona whose properties most notably its radial density dependence are imprinted in them we compute the corresponding power spectral densities psd autocorrelation functions time skewness of the light curves and time lags between the light curves of the sources at different photon energies and compare our results to observation our model light curves compare well with observations providing good fits to their overall morphology as manifest by the autocorrelation and skewness functions the lags and psds of the model light curves are also in good agreement with those observed the model can even accommodate the presence of qpos finally while most of the variability power resides at time scales gsim a few seconds at the same time the model allows also for shots of a few msec in duration in accordance with observation we suggest that refinements of this type of model along with spectral and phase lag information can be used to probe the structure of this class of high energy sources,astro-ph

in order to associate complex traits with genetic polymorphisms genomewide association studies process huge datasets involving tens of thousands of individuals genotyped for millions of polymorphisms when handling these datasets which exceed the main memory of contemporary computers one faces two distinct challenges millions of polymorphisms come at the cost of hundreds of gigabytes of genotype data which can only be kept in secondary storage the relatedness of the test population is represented by a covariance matrix which for large populations can only fit in the combined main memory of a distributed architecture in this paper we present solutions for both challenges the genotype data is streamed from and to secondary storage using a double buffering technique while the covariance matrix is kept across the main memory of a distributed memory system we show that these methods sustain highperformance and allow the analysis of enormous dataset,cs

we study numerically the formation of molecular clouds in largescale colliding flows including selfgravity the models emphasize the competition between the effects of gravity on global and local scales in an isolated cloud global gravity builds up largescale filaments while local gravity triggered by a combination of strong thermal and dynamical instabilities causes cores to form the dynamical instabilities give rise to a local focusing of the colliding flows facilitating the rapid formation of massive protostellar cores of a few m_odot the forming clouds do not reach an equilibrium state though the motions within the clouds appear comparable to virial the selfsimilar core mass distributions derived from models with and without selfgravity indicate that the core mass distribution is set very early on during the cloud formation process predominantly by a combination of thermal and dynamical instabilities rather than by selfgravity,astro-ph

strongly coupled immersed boundary ib methods solve the nonlinear fluid and structural equations of motion simultaneously for strongly enforcing the noslip constraint on the body handling this constraint requires solving several large dimensional systems that scale by the number of grid points in the flow domain even though the nonlinear constraints scale only by the small number of points used to represent the fluidstructure interface these costly large scale operations for determining only a small number of unknowns at the interface creates a bottleneck to efficiently timeadvancing strongly coupled ib methods in this manuscript we present a remedy for this bottleneck that is motivated by the efficient strategy employed in stationarybody ib methods while preserving the favorable stability properties of strongly coupled algorithms we precompute a matrix that encapsulates the large dimensional system so that the prohibitive large scale operations need not be performed at every time step this precomputation process yields a modified system of smalldimensional constraint equations that is solved at minimal computational cost while time advancing the equations we also present a parallel implementation that scales favorably across multiple processors the accuracy computational efficiency and scalability of our approach are demonstrated on several two dimensional flow problems although the demonstration problems consist of a combination of rigid and torsionally mounted bodies the formulation is derived in a more general setting involving an arbitrary number of rigid torsionally mounted and continuously deformable bodies,physics

a traditional assumption underlying most data converters is that the signal should be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency this statement is based on a worstcase scenario in which the signal occupies the entire available bandwidth in practice many signals are sparse so that only part of the bandwidth is used in this paper we develop methods for lowrate sampling of continuoustime sparse signals in shiftinvariant si spaces generated by m kernels with period t we model sparsity by treating the case in which only k out of the m generators are active however we do not know which k are chosen we show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than mt which is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity our approach combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite counterpart using these two components we formulate our problem within the framework of finite compressed sensing cs and then rely on algorithms developed in that context the distinguishing feature of our results is that in contrast to standard cs which treats finitelength vectors we consider sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finitedimensional model exists the proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature on cs to the analog domain,cs
to improve policy robustness of deep reinforcement learning agents a line of recent works focus on producing disturbances of the environment existing approaches of the literature to generate meaningful disturbances of the environment are adversarial reinforcement learning methods these methods set the problem as a twoplayer game between the protagonist agent which learns to perform a task in an environment and the adversary agent which learns to disturb the protagonist via modifications of the considered environment both protagonist and adversary are trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms alternatively we propose in this paper to build on gradientbased adversarial attacks usually used for classification tasks for instance that we apply on the critic network of the protagonist to identify efficient disturbances of the environment rather than learning an attacker policy which usually reveals as very complex and unstable we leverage the knowledge of the critic network of the protagonist to dynamically complexify the task at each step of the learning process we show that our method while being faster and lighter leads to significantly better improvements in policy robustness than existing methods of the literature,cs

using simultaneous very long baseline array and neil gehrels swift observatory xray telescope observations of the active galactic nucleus agn in ngc over a sixmonth observing campaign we observed a large drop in core cm radio luminosity by a factor of in tandem with factor of increase in kev xray luminosity while ngc has long been an important object for studies of xray variability our study is the first simultaneous xray and radio variability campaign on this object we observe that the xray spectral index does not change over the course of the flare consistent with a change in the bulk amount of comptonizing plasma potentially due to a magnetic reconnection event in the accretion disk the drop in apparent radio luminosity can be explained by a change in freefree absorption which we calculate to correspond to an ionized region with physical extent and electron density consistent with the broad line region blr our results are consistent with magnetic reconnection events in the dynamic accretion disk creating outbursts of ionizing material increasing compton upscattering of uv accretion disk photons and feeding material into the blr these findings present an important physical picture for the dynamical relationship between xray and radio emission in agns,astro-ph
amperean superconductivity is an exotic phenomenon stemming from attractive effective electronelectron interactions eeeis mediated by a transverse gauge field originally introduced in the context of quantum spin liquids and hightc superconductors amperean superconductivity has been recently proposed to occur at temperatures on the order of k in twodimensional parabolicband electron gases embedded inside deep subwavelength optical cavities in this work we first generalize the microscopic theory of cavityinduced amperean superconductivity to the case of graphene and then argue that this superconducting state cannot be achieved in the deep subwavelength regime in the latter regime indeed a cavity induces only eeeis between density fluctuations rather than the currentcurrent interactions which are responsible for amperean pairing,cond-mat
based on the localization result for descendants in rational sft moduli spaces from our last joint paper we prove topological recursion relations for the hamiltonian in sft of symplectic mapping tori and in local sft combined with the dilaton equation in sft we use them to prove a reconstruction theorem for descendants from primaries while it turns out that in contrast to gromovwitten theory and nonequivariant cylindrical contact homology the descendant hamiltonian cannot be computed from the hamiltonian without descendants alone we get that the only additional piece of information needed is the first descendant hamiltonian which counts holomorphic curves tangent to the symplectic fibre as already known from the explicit computations in local sft it follows that the descendant sft invariants in general contain more geometric information than the primary sft invariants,math

hierarchical autocorrelation in the error term of linear models arises when sampling units are related to each other according to a tree the residual covariance is parametrized using the treedistance between sampling units when observations are modeled using an ornsteinuhlenbeck ou process along the tree the autocorrelation between two tips decreases exponentially with their tree distance these models are most often applied in evolutionary biology when tips represent biological species and the ou process parameters represent the strength and direction of natural selection for these models we show that the mean is not microergodic no estimator can ever be consistent for this parameter and provide a lower bound for the variance of its mle for covariance parameters we give a general sufficient condition ensuring microergodicity this condition suggests that some parameters may not be estimated at the same rate as others we show that indeed maximum likelihood estimators of the autocorrelation parameter converge at a slower rate than that of generally microergodic parameters we showed this theoretically in a symmetric tree asymptotic framework and through simulations on a large real tree comprising mammal species,math

firstprinciples based lattice models allow the modeling of ab initio thermodynamics of crystalline mixtures for applications such as the construction of phase diagrams and the identification of ground state atomic orderings the recent development of compressive sensing approaches for the construction of lattice models has further enabled the systematic construction of sparse physical models without the need for human intuition other than requiring the compactness of effective cluster interactions however conventional compressive sensing based on lnorm regularization is strictly only applicable to certain classes of optimization problems and is otherwise not guaranteed to generate optimally sparse and transferable results so that the method can only be applied to some materials science applications in this paper we illustrate a more robust llnorm compressivesensing method that removes the limitations of conventional compressive sensing and generally results in sparser lattice models that are at least as predictive as those obtained from lnorm compressive sensing apart from the theory a practical implementation based on stateoftheart mixedinteger quadratic programming miqp is proposed the robustness of our methodology is illustrated for four different transitionmetal oxides with relevance as battery cathode materials lixtixo lixniyo mgxcro and naxcro this method provides a practical and robust approach for the construction of sparser and more predictive lattice models improving on the compressive sensing paradigm and making it applicable to a much broader range of applications,physics
if dark matter decays or annihilates into electrons and positrons it can affect radiation and cosmicray backgrounds we review a novel more general analysis of constraints on decaying dark matter models by introducing the response functions based on the current radio gammaray and positron observations constraints can be simply obtained by requiring the convolution of the response functions with actual decay spectrum of electrons and positrons smaller than the product of decay lifetime in s and mass in gev the response functions just depend on the astrophysical inputs such as the propagation model but not on the microscopic decay scenario moreover an anisotropy analysis of the fullsky radio emissions to identify the extragalactic dark matter annihilation is shown we discuss the angular power spectra of the cosmological synchrotron emission from dark matter annihilations into electron positron pairs and compare them with astrophysical backgrounds and galactic foregrounds we find that the angular power spectrum of radio fluxes at around ghz frequencies and in the range of l opens a optimal window to disentangle the dark matter signals from common astrophysical backgrounds,astro-ph
cogent has taken data for over years with live days of data accumulated as of april we report on the results of a maximum likelihood analysis to extract any possible dark matter signal present in the collected data the maximum likelihood signal extraction uses dimensional probability density functions pdfs to characterize the anticipated variations in dark matter interaction rates for given observable nuclear recoil energies during differing periods of the earths annual orbit around the sun cosmogenic and primordial radioactivity backgrounds are characterized by their energy signatures and in some cases decay halflives a third parameterizing variable pulse risetime is added to the likelihood analysis to characterize slow rising pulses described in prior analyses the contribution to each event category is analyzed for various dark matter signal hypotheses including a dark matter standard halo model and a case with free oscillation parameters ie amplitude period and phase the bestfit dark matter signal is in close proximity to previously reported results we find that the significance of the extracted dark matter signal remains well below evidentiary at sigma,astro-ph
in recent years understanding the implicit regularization of neural networks nns has become a central task of deep learning theory however implicit regularization is in itself not completely defined and well understood in this work we make an attempt to mathematically define and study the implicit regularization importantly we explore the limitation of a common approach of characterizing the implicit regularization by dataindependent functions we propose two dynamical mechanisms ie twopoint and onepoint overlapping mechanisms based on which we provide two recipes for producing classes of onehiddenneuron nns that provably cannot be fully characterized by a type of or all dataindependent functions our results signify the profound datadependency of implicit regularization in general inspiring us to study in detail the datadependency of nn implicit regularization in the future,cs
we study a rectifying mutant of the ompf porin ion channel using both allatom and reduced models the mutant was created by miedema et al nano lett on the basis of the np semiconductor diode in which an np junction is formed the mutant contains a pore region with positive amino acids on the lefthand side and negative amino acids on the righthand side experiments show that this mutant rectifies although we do not know the structure of this mutant we can build an allatom model for it on the basis of the structure of the wild type channel interestingly molecular dynamics simulations for this allatom model do not produce rectification a reduced model that contains only the important degrees of freedom the positive and negative amino acids and free ions in an implicit solvent on the other hand exhibits rectification our calculations for the reduced model using the nernstplanck equation coupled to local equilibrium monte carlo simulations reveal a rectification mechanism that is different from that seen for semiconductor diodes the basic reason is that the ions are different in nature from electrons and holes they do not recombine we provide explanations for the failure of the allatom model including the effect of all the other atoms in the system as a noise that inhibits the response of ions that would be necessary for rectification to the polarizing external field,cond-mat
poisson structures of divisortype are those whose degeneracy can be captured by a divisor ideal which is a locally principal ideal sheaf with nowheredense quotient support this is a large class of poisson structures which includes all genericallynondegenerate poisson structures such as log bk elliptic ellipticlog and scattering poisson structures divisor ideals are used to define almostinjective lie algebroids of derivations preserving them to which these poisson structures can be lifted often nondegenerately so the resulting symplectic lie algebroids can be studied using tools from symplectic geometry in this paper we develop an effective framework for the study of poisson structures of divisortype also called almostregular poisson structures and their lie algebroids we provide lifting criteria for such poisson structures develop the language of divisors on smooth manifolds and discuss residue maps to extract information from lie algebroid forms along their degeneraci loci,math
recently deep models have been successfully applied in several applications especially with lowlevel representations however sparse noisy samples and structured domains with multiple objects and interactions are some of the open challenges in most deep models column networks a deep architecture can succinctly capture such domain structure and interactions but may still be prone to suboptimal learning from sparse and noisy samples inspired by the success of humanadvice guided learning in ai especially in datascarce domains we propose knowledgeaugmented column networks that leverage human adviceknowledge for better learning with noisysparse samples our experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to either superior overall performance or faster convergence ie both effective and efficient,cs

when metals are plastically deformed the total density of dislocations increases with strain as the microstructure is continuously refined leading to the strain hardening behavior here we report the fundamental role played by the junction formation process in the connection between dislocation microstructure evolution and the strain hardening rate in facecentered cubic fcc cu as revealed by discrete dislocation dynamics ddd simulations the dislocation network formed during loading consists of line segments whose lengths closely follow an exponential distribution this exponential distribution is a consequence of junction formation by dislocations on different slip planes which can be modeled as a onedimensional poisson process we show that according to the exponential distribution the dislocation microstructure evolution is governed by two nondimensional parameters and the hardening rate is controlled by the rate of stable junction formation by selectively disabling specific junction types in ddd simulations we find that among the four types of junctions in fcc crystals glissile junctions make the dominant contribution to the strain hardening rate,cond-mat

studies of the threedimensional d structures of galactic magnetic fields are now entering a new era with broadband highly sensitive radio observations and new analysis methods to reveal the magnetic field configuration from the observed value integrated along the line of sight it is necessary to derive an appropriate model that can reproduce the observational characteristics we aim to clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial distribution of physical quantities through pseudoobservations using global d magnetohydrodynamics mhd simulation results in particular we focus on using the depolarization effect to verify the polarization model and to identify the emission region first we show that wavelengthindependent depolarization which takes into account anisotropic turbulence does not work efficiently because the polarized emission is stronger in regions of ordered spiral fields than in regions dominated by isotropic turbulent fields beam depolarization becomes more effective below ghz although close to the equatorial plane there will be strong depolarization which increases with observing wavelength this effect is less in the halo making halo magnetic fields detectable through their polarized emission at meterwavelength bands although polarized emission from the halo is below the detection limit of current facilities it will be detectable within the ska era in addition we found that the spiral polarization projected on a screen is produced by overlapping magnetic flux tubes extending to different heights from the equatorial plane this suggests that the traditional classification of global magnetic fields has difficulty reproducing the global structure of the magnetic fields finally we demonstrate the method to separate magnetic flux tubes at different heights by using peak frequencies which cause the decreasing of polarized flux,astro-ph
the exponential family is well known in machine learning and statistical physics as the maximum entropy distribution subject to a set of observed constraints while the geometric mixture path is common in mcmc methods such as annealed importance sampling linking these two ideas recent work has interpreted the geometric mixture path as an exponential family of distributions to analyze the thermodynamic variational objective tvo we extend these likelihood ratio exponential families to include solutions to ratedistortion rd optimization the information bottleneck ib method and recent ratedistortionclassification approaches which combine rd and ib this provides a common mathematical framework for understanding these methods via the conjugate duality of exponential families and hypothesis testing further we collect existing results to provide a variational representation of intermediate rd or tvo distributions as a minimizing an expectation of kl divergences this solution also corresponds to a sizepower tradeoff using the likelihood ratio test and the neyman pearson lemma in thermodynamic integration bounds such as the tvo we identify the intermediate distribution whose expected sufficient statistics match the log partition function,cs

many hierarchically modular systems are structured in a way that resembles an hourglass this hourglass effect means that the system generates many outputs from many inputs through a relatively small number of intermediate modules that are critical for the operation of the entire system referred to as the waist of the hourglass we investigate the hourglass effect in general not necessarily layered hierarchical dependency networks our analysis focuses on the number of sourcetotarget dependency paths that traverse each vertex and it identifies the core of a dependency network as the smallest set of vertices that collectively cover almost all dependency paths we then examine if a given network exhibits the hourglass property or not comparing its core size with a flat ie nonhierarchical network that preserves the source dependencies of each target in the original network as a possible explanation for the hourglass effect we propose the reuse preference rp model that captures the bias of new modules to reuse intermediate modules of similar complexity instead of connecting directly to sources or low complexity modules we have applied the proposed framework in a diverse set of dependency networks from technological natural and information systems showing that all these networks exhibit the general hourglass property but to a varying degree and with different waist characteristics,cs

in centre of core regular double stone algebra crdsa many useful results are shown that begin to indicate the nearly boolean nature of crdsa which we focus on here we define the node set lattice through the well known binary operations of ternary set partitions and show the resultant lattice is isomorphic to cj where c is the element chain crdsa we derive that every crdsa is a subdirect product of c similarly as for boolean algebras and c we use these results to show that every boolean algebra is the center of some crdsa next we show that c is primal implying that the variety generated by it is dually equivalent to the category of boolean algebras in some sense this is a last step towards our goal of establishing crdsa as nearly boolean but leaves us a bit dissatisfied hence we continue by establishing a duality between the category of crdsa and specifically crafted bitopological spaces towards this end we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a pairwise zerodimensional space such that it will have a crdsa base b we note that these conditions are indicative of how nearly boolean crdsa are for example if u in b is not clopencomplemented then clu is in b and is clopencomplemented then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a bicontinuous map to have an inverse that is a crdsa homomorphism again indicating how nearly boolean crdsa are these inverses must respect the appropriate conditions on the boundary of nonclopen elements of b in culmination we show the category of core regular double stone algebras is dually equivalent to the category of what we call core regular double pairwise stone spaces we note that the conditions for this duality can easily be relaxed to yield a duality for a less rigid class lattices than crdsa bounded distributive pseudocomplemented lattices for example,math
email classification is still a mostly manual task consequently most web mail users never define a single folder recently however automatic classification offering the same categories to all users has started to appear in some web mail clients such as aol or gmail we adopt this approach rather than previous unsuccessful personalized approaches because of the change in the nature of consumer email traffic which is now dominated by nonspam machinegenerated email we propose here a novel approach for automatically distinguishing between personal and machinegenerated email and classifying messages into latent categories without requiring users to have defined any folder we report how we have discovered that a set of latent categories one for human and the others for machinegenerated messages can explain a significant portion of email traffic we describe in details the steps involved in building a webscale email categorization system from the collection of groundtruth labels the selection of features to the training of models experimental evaluation was performed on more than billion messages received during a period of six months by users of yahoo mail service who elected to be part of such research studies our system achieved precision and recall rates close to and the latent categories we discovered were shown to cover of both email traffic and email search queries we believe that these results pave the way for a change of approach in the web mail industry and could support the invention of new largescale email discovery paradigms that had not been possible before,cs
copulas are known to satisfy a number of regularity properties and one might therefore believe that their densities when they exist admit a certain degree of regularity themselves we show that this is not true in general by constructing a broad family of copulas which admit densities that can hardly be considered regular the copula densities are constructed from arbitrary univariate densities supported on the unit interval and we show by example that the copula densities can inherit pathological behaviour from the underlying univariate densities in particular we construct a nontrivial univariate density which is unbounded in every open set of the unit interval and show that it induces a copula density which is finite everywhere but unbounded in every neighborhood of the unit hypercube nevertheless all of our copulas are shown to enjoy attractive smoothness properties,math
in a recent paper bogoyavlenskiy v a jpa textbf an algorithm aiming to generate isotropic clusters of the onlattice diffusionlimited aggregation dla model was proposed the procedure consists of aggregation probabilities proportional to the squared number of occupied sites k in the present work we analyzed this algorithm using the noise reduced version of the dla model and large scale simulations in the noiseless limit instead of isotropic patterns a circ circ rotation in the anisotropy directions of the clusters grown on square triangular lattices was observed a generalized algorithm in which the aggregation probability is proportional to knu was proposed the exponent nu has a nonuniversal critical value nu_c for which the patterns generated in the noiseless limit exhibit the original axial anisotropy for nunu_c and the rotated one diagonal for nunu_c the values nu_c pm and nu_c pm were found for square and triangular lattices respectively moreover large scale simulations show that there are a nontrivial relation between noise reduction and anisotropy direction the case nu bogos rule is an example where the patterns exhibit the axial anisotropy for small and the diagonal one for large noise reduction,cond-mat

it is demonstrated that in fullerene c which can be considered as a deformed fullerene c in some sense there is a withdrawal of an electrodynamical forbiddance of a strong quadrupole lightmolecule interaction which is realized in the fullerene c this situation occurs because of the reduction of symmetry of c from the icosahedral symmetry group yh to the group dh the withdrawal results in appearance of the lines in the sers spectra of c which are forbidden in usual raman scattering and are allowed in infrared absorption while such lines are forbidden in the sers spectrum of the fullerene c due to the electrodynamical forbiddance the measured sers spectra of c demonstrates existence of such lines that strongly confirms our ideas about the dipole quadrupole sers mechanism,physics
the pump process of the ratchet model inspired by the f_o rotatory motor of atp synthase is investigated in this model there are two kinds of characteristic time one is dynamical the relaxation time of the system others are chemical the chemical reaction rates at which a proton binds to or dissociates from the motor protein the inequalities between them affect the behavior of the physical quantities such as the rotation velocity and the proton pumping rates across the membrane the energy transduction efficiency is calculated and the condition under which the efficiency can become higher is discussed the proton pumping rate and the efficiency have a peak where a certain set of inequalities between the chemical reaction rates and the reciprocal of the relaxation time holds the efficiency also has a peak for a certain value of the load the best efficiency condition for the pump process is consistent with that for the motor process,physics

mutually beneficial cooperation is a common part of economic systems as firms in partial cooperation with others can often make a higher sustainable profit though cooperative games were popular in s recent interest in noncooperative games is prevalent despite the fact that cooperative bargaining seems to be more useful in economic and political applications in this paper we assume that the strategy space and time are inseparable with respect to a contract under this assumption we show that the strategy spacetime is a dynamic curved liouvillelike brane quantum gravity surface under asymmetric information and that traditional euclidean geometry fails to give a proper feedback nash equilibrium cooperation occurs when two firms strategies fall into each others influence curvature in this strategy spacetime small firms in an economy dominated by large firms are subject to the influence of large firms we determine an optimal feedback semicooperation of the small firm in this case using a liouvillefeynman path integral method,math

using exact expressions for the persistence probability and for the leading eigenvalue of the fockerplanck operator of a random walk in a random environment we establish a fundamental relation between the statistical properties of anomalous diffusion and the critical and offcritical behavior of random quantum spin chains many new exact results are obtained from this correspondence including the space and time correlations of surviving random walks and the distribution of the gaps of the corresponding fockerplanck operator in turn we derive analytically the dynamical exponent of the random transversefield ising spin chain in the griffithsmccoy region,cond-mat
the critical behavior of the randomfield ising model has been a puzzle for a long time different theoretical methods predict that the critical exponents of the randomfield ferromagnet in d dimensions are the same as in the pure ddimensional ferromagnet with the same number of the magnetization components this result contradicts the experiments and simulations we calculate the critical exponents of the randomfield on model with the epsilonexpansion and obtain values different from the critical exponents of the pure ferromagnet in epsilon dimensions in contrast to the previous approaches we take into account an infinite set of relevant operators emerging in the problem we demonstrate how these previously missed relevant operators lead to the breakdown of the epsilonexpansion for the randomfield ising model,cond-mat

we examine twosided markets where players arrive stochastically over time and are drawn from a continuum of types the cost of matching a client and provider varies so a social planner is faced with two contending objectives a to reduce players waiting time before getting matched and b to form efficient pairs in order to reduce matching costs we show that such markets are characterized by a quickorcheap dilemma under a large class of distributional assumptions there is no free lunch ie there exists no clearing schedule that is simultaneously optimal along both objectives we further identify a unique breaking point signifying a stark reduction in matching cost contrasted by an increase in waiting time generalizing this model we identify two regimes one where no free lunch exists the other where a window of opportunity opens to achieve a free lunch remarkably greedy scheduling is never optimal in this setting,cs

deep reinforcement learning agents have recently been successful across a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks however they can be slow to train and require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn a suitable policy this is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning agent has no prior knowledge of the world no preexisting data to depend on and so must devote considerable time to exploration transfer learning can alleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task to help learning on some target task our work presents an algorithm for initialising the hidden feature representation of the target task we propose a domain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate transfer across domains tasks and action spaces we utilise adversarial domain adaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture we align our new policies representation space with a pretrained source policy taking target task data generated from a random policy we demonstrate that this initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new reinforcement learning task which highlights the wide applicability of adversarial adaptation methods even as the task and labelaction space also changes,cs

the verification of systems combining hard timing constraints with concurrency is challenging this challenge becomes even harder when some timing constants are missing or unknown parametric timed formalisms such as parametric timed automata ptas tackle the synthesis of such timing constants seen as parameters for which a property holds such formalisms are highly expressive but also undecidable and few decidable subclasses were proposed we propose here a syntactic restriction on ptas consisting in removing guards constraints on transitions to keep only invariants constraints on locations while this restriction preserves the expressiveness of ptas and therefore their undecidability an additional restriction on the type of constraints allows to not only prove decidability but also to perform the exact synthesis of parameter valuations satisfying reachability this formalism that seems trivial at first sight as it benefits from the decidability of the reachability problem with a better complexity than timed automata tas suffers from the undecidability of the whole tctl logic that tas on the contrary enjoy we believe our formalism allows for an interesting tradeoff between decidability and practical expressiveness and is therefore promising we show its applicability in a small case study,cs

we study the b rings complex optical depth structure the source of this structure may be the complex dynamics of the keplerian shear and the selfgravity of the ring particles the outcome of these dynamic effects depends sensitively on the collisional and physical properties of the particles two mechanisms can emerge that dominate the macroscopic physical structure of the ring selfgravity wakes and viscous overstability here we study the interplay between these two mechanisms by using our recently developed particle collision method that allows us to better model the interparticle contact physics we find that for a constant ring surface density and particle internal density particles with rough surfaces tend to produce axisymmetric ring features associated with the viscous overstability while particles with smoother surfaces produce selfgravity wakes,astro-ph

we examine the micron to xray color of xrayselected agn as a function of xray obscuration and optical classification in the chandra deep field south the sample consists of the chandra hardband detections with hard flux ergscm a deep micron mosaic obtained with spitzer provides midinfrared fluxes for the sample since obscured agn locally have higher micron kev ratios than unobscured agn and since xray background models predict a large population of obscured agn we expect to find many xrayhard irbright agn instead we find that the micron to xray flux ratio does not depend on xray hardness in the full sample nor does it differ between narrowline and broadline agn we identify nearly comptonthick agn and find they have similar micron to xray flux ratios compared to the full sample we consider agn in the narrow redshift spikes at z for these agn there is some evidence that the flux ratio increases with xray hardness the redshift slice also shows an odd trend which is also prominent in the full sample a group of xrayhard agn with very low micron to xray flux ratios,astro-ph
we present high precision photometry of kepler a giant planet in a day orbit around a gv star that was recently confirmed through radial velocity measurements we have developed a new method to confirm giant planets solely from the photometric light curve and we apply this method herein to kepler to establish the validity of this technique we generate a full phase photometric model by including the primary and secondary transits ellipsoidal variations doppler beaming and reflectedemitted light from the planet third light contamination scenarios that can mimic a planetary transit signal are simulated by injecting a full range of dilution values into the model and we refit each diluted light curve model to the light curve the resulting constraints on the maximum occultation depth and stellar density combined with stellar evolution models rules out stellar blends and provides a measurement of the planets mass size and temperature we expect about two dozen kepler giant planets can be confirmed via this method,astro-ph

we measure the angular autocorrelation functions w of sdss galaxies selected to have photometric redshifts z and absolute rband magnitudes mr we split these galaxies into five overlapping redshift shells of width and measure w in each subsample in order to investigate the evolution of sdss galaxies we find that the bias increases substantially with redshift much more so than one would expect for a passively evolving sample we use halomodel analysis to determine the bestfit halooccupationdistribution hod for each subsample and the bestfit models allow us to interpret the change in bias physically in order to properly interpret our bestfit hods we convert each halo mass to its z passively evolved bias bo enabling a direct comparison of the bestfit hods at different redshifts we find that the minimum halo bo required to host a galaxy decreases as the redshift decreases suggesting that galaxies with mr are forming in halos at the lowmass end of the hods over our redshift range we use the bestfit hods to determine the change in occupation number divided by the change in mass of halos with constant bo and we find a sharp peak at bo corresponding to an average halo mass of msolh we thus present the following scenario the bias of galaxies with mr decreases as the universe evolves because these galaxies form in halos of mass msolh independent of redshift and the bias of these halos naturally decreases as the universe evolves,astro-ph

deep neural networks have achieved tremendous success due to their representation power and adaptation to lowdimensional structures their potential for estimating structured regression functions has been recently established in the literature however most of the studies require the input dimension to be fixed and consequently ignore the effect of dimension on the rate of convergence and hamper their applications to modern big data with high dimensionality in this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing a kth order nonparametric interaction model in both growing dimension scenarios d grows with n but at a slower rate and in high dimension d gtrsim n in the latter case sparsity assumptions and associated regularization are required in order to obtain optimal rates of convergence a new challenge in diverging dimension setting is in calculation meansquare error the covariance terms among estimated additive components are an order of magnitude larger than those of the variances and they can deteriorate statistical properties without proper care we introduce a critical debiasing technique to amend the problem we show that under certain standard assumptions debiased deep neural networks achieve a minimax optimal rate both in terms of n d our proof techniques rely crucially on a novel debiasing technique that makes the covariances of additive components negligible in the meansquare error calculation in addition we establish the matching lower bounds,math
so far most studies on the structure of coronal mass ejections cmes are conducted through whitelight coronagraphs which demonstrate about one third of cmes exhibit the typical threepart structure in the high corona eg beyond rs ie the bright front the dark cavity and the bright core in this paper we address the cme structure in the low corona eg below rs through extremeultraviolet euv passbands and find that the threepart cmes in the whitelight images can possess a similar threepart appearance in the euv images ie a leading edge a lowdensity zone and a filament or hot channel the analyses identify that the leading edge and the filament or hot channel in the euv passbands evolve into the front and the core later within several solar radii in the whitelight passbands respectively whats more we find that the cmes without obvious cavity in the whitelight images can also exhibit the clear threepart appearance in the euv images which means that the lowdensity zone in the euv images observed as the cavity in whitelight images can be compressed andor transformed gradually by the expansion of the bright core andor the reconnection of magnetic field surrounding the core during the cme propagation outward our study suggests that more cmes can possess the clear threepart structure in their early eruption stage the nature of the lowdensity zone between the leading edge and the filament or hot channel is discussed,astro-ph

extracting times of arrival from pulsar radio signals depends on the knowledge of the pulsars pulse profile and how this template is generated we examine pulsar template generation with bayesian methods we will contrast the classical generation mechanism of averaging intensity profiles with a new approach based on bayesian inference we introduce the bayesian measurement model imposed and derive the algorithm to reconstruct a statistical template out of noisy data the properties of these statistical templates are analysed with simulated and real measurement data from psr b we explain how to put this new form of template to use in analysing secondary parameters of interest and give various examples we implement a nonlinear filter for determining toas of pulsars applying this method to data from psr j we derive toas self consistently meaning all epochs were timed and we used the same epochs for template generation while the average template contains fluctuations and noise as unavoidable artifacts we find that the statistical template derived by bayesian inference quantifies fluctuations and remaining uncertainty this is why the algorithm suggested turns out to reconstruct templates of statistical significance from ten to fifty single pulses a moving data window of fifty pulses taking out one single pulse at the beginning and adding one at the end of the window unravels the characteristics of the methods to be compared it shows that the change induced in the classical reconstruction is dominated by random fluctuations for the average template while statistically significant changes drive the dynamics of the proposed methods reconstruction the analysis of phase shifts with simulated data reveals that the proposed nonlinear algorithm is able to reconstruct correct phase information along with an acceptable estimation of the remaining uncertainty,astro-ph

in this work we explore the effects of adopting initial mass functions imfs variable in time on the chemical evolution of the galaxy in order to do that we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes for the formation of the galaxy and which proved to be successful in reproducing the majority of the observational constraints at least for the case of a constant imf different variable imfs are tested with this model all assuming that massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity this implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and at large galactocentric distances our numerical results have shown that all the variable imfs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevant observational constraints in the galaxy and that a constant imf still reproduces better the observations in particular variable imfs of the kind explored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients even when allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as for instance the star formation rate as a consequence of this we conclude that the gdwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large timescale and a constant imf since it is possible to find variable imfs of the kind studied here reproducing the gdwarf metallicity but this worsen the agreement with other observational constraints,astro-ph

contextual synonym knowledge is crucial for those similarityoriented tasks whose core challenge lies in capturing semantic similarity between entities in their contexts such as entity linking and entity matching however most pretrained language models plms lack synonym knowledge due to inherent limitations of their pretraining objectives such as masked language modeling mlm existing works which inject synonym knowledge into plms often suffer from two severe problems i neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms and ii undermining semantic understanding of original plms which is caused by inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus to address these issues we propose picso a flexible framework that supports the injection of contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into plms via a novel entityaware adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities synonyms in the contexts meanwhile picso stores the synonym knowledge in additional parameters of the adapter structure which prevents it from corrupting the semantic understanding of the original plm extensive experiments demonstrate that picso can dramatically outperform the original plms and the other knowledge and synonym injection models on four different similarityoriented tasks in addition experiments on glue prove that picso also benefits general natural language understanding tasks codes and data will be public,cs

entity alignment ea aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs kgs that refer to the same realworld identity to systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudolabelingbased entity alignment we propose a unified pseudolabeling framework for entity alignment uplea that explicitly eliminates pseudolabeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment uplea consists of two complementary components the optimal transport otbased pseudolabeling uses discrete ot modeling as an effective means to enable more accurate determination of entity correspondences across two kgs and to mitigate the adverse impact of erroneous matches a simple but highly effective criterion is further devised to derive pseudolabeled entity pairs that satisfy onetoone correspondences at each iteration the crossiteration pseudolabel calibration operates across multiple consecutive iterations to further improve the pseudolabeling precision rate by reducing the local pseudolabel selection variability with a theoretical guarantee the two components are respectively designed to eliminate type i and type ii pseudolabeling errors identified through our analyse the calibrated pseudolabels are thereafter used to augment prior alignment seeds to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference the effectiveness of uplea in eliminating pseudolabeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated the experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance with limited prior alignment seeds,cs

context continuum time delays from accretion disks in active galactic nuclei agn has been proposed long time ago as a tool for measuring distances to the monitored sources however the method faces serious problems as a number of effects must be taken into account including the contribution from the broad line region blr aims in this paper we model the expected time delays when both the disk reprocessing of the incident xray flux and further reprocessing by the blr are included with the aim to see if the two effects can be disentangled methods we use simple response function for the accretion disk without relativistic effects and we use a parametric description to account for the blr contribution we include only scattering of the disk emission by the blr intercloud medium we also use artificial lightcurves with day sampling to check if the effects are likely to be seen in real data results we show that the effect of the blr scattering on the predicted time delay is very similar to the effect of rising height of the xray source without any blr contribution this brings additional degeneracy if we want in the future to recover the parameters of the system from the observed time delays in a specific object both effects however modify the slope of the delay versus wavelength curve when plotted in log space which opens a way to obtaining bare disk time delay needed for cosmology in addition when the disk irradiation is strong the modification of the predicted delay by the blr scattering and by xray source height become considerably different however the required data quality must be high since our artificial curves with day sampling give rather noisy results,astro-ph

we study algorithmic problems on subsets of euclidean space of low fractal dimension these spaces are the subject of intensive study in various branches of mathematics including geometry topology and measure theory there are several wellstudied notions of fractal dimension for sets and measures in euclidean space we consider a definition of fractal dimension for finite metric spaces which agrees with standard notions used to empirically estimate the fractal dimension of various sets we define the fractal dimension of some metric space to be the infimum delta such that for any epsilon for any ball b of radius rgeq epsilon and for any epsilon net n that is for any maximal epsilon packing we have bcap norepsilondelta using this definition we obtain faster algorithms for a plethora of classical problems on sets of low fractal dimension in euclidean space our results apply to exact and fixedparameter algorithms approximation schemes and spanner constructions interestingly the dependence of the performance of these algorithms on the fractal dimension nearly matches the currently bestknown dependence on the standard euclidean dimension thus when the fractal dimension is strictly smaller than the ambient dimension our results yield improved solutions in all of these settings,cs

service robots for the domestic environment are intended to autonomously provide support for their users however stateoftheart robots still often get stuck in failure situations leading to breakdowns in the interaction flow from which the robot cannot recover alone we performed a multiuser wizardofoz experiment in which we manipulated the robots behavior in such a way that it appeared unexpected and malfunctioning and asked participants to help the robot in order to restore the interaction flow we examined how participants reacted to the robots error its subsequent request for help and how it changed their perception of the robot with respect to perceived intelligence likability and task contribution as interaction scenario we used a game of building lego models performed by user dyads in total participants interacted with the robot and helped in malfunctioning situations we report two major findings in user dyads the user who gave the last command followed by the user who is closer is more likely to help malfunctions that can be actively fixed by the user seem not to negatively impact perceived intelligence and likability ratings this work offers insights in how far user support can be a strategy for domestic service robots to recover from repeating malfunctions,cs
we investigate atomistic details of a single atom extraction process realized by using scanning tunneling microscope stm tipcluster interaction on a ag surface at k single atoms are extracted from a silver cluster one atom at a time using small tunneling biases less than mv and a threshold tunneling resistance of kohm a combination of total energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations shows a lowering of the atom extraction barrier upon approaching the tip to the cluster thus a mere tuning of the proximity between the tip and the cluster governs the extraction process and is sufficient to extract an atom the atomically precise control and reproducibility of the process are demonstrated by repeatedly extracting single atoms from a silver cluster on an atombyatom basis,cond-mat
we study the vision transformer structure in the mobile level in this paper and find a dramatic performance drop we analyze the reason behind this phenomenon and propose a novel irregular patch embedding module and adaptive patch fusion module to improve the performance we conjecture that the vision transformer blocks which consist of multihead attention and feedforward network are more suitable to handle highlevel information than lowlevel features the irregular patch embedding module extracts patches that contain rich highlevel information with different receptive fields the transformer blocks can obtain the most useful information from these irregular patches then the processed patches pass the adaptive patch merging module to get the final features for the classifier with our proposed improvements the traditional uniform vision transformer structure can achieve stateoftheart results in mobile level we improve the deit baseline by more than under the mobilelevel settings and surpass other transformer architectures like swin and coat by a large margin,cs

registration of d point clouds is a fundamental task in several applications of robotics and computer vision while registration methods such as iterative closest point and variants are very popular they are only locally optimal there has been some recent work on globally optimal registration but they perform poorly in the presence of noise in the measurements in this work we develop a mixed integer programmingbased approach for globally optimal registration that explicitly considers uncertainty in its optimization and hence produces more accurate estimates furthermore from a practical implementation perspective we develop a multistep optimization that combines fast local methods with our accurate global formulation through extensive simulation and real world experiments we demonstrate improved performance over stateoftheart methods for various level of noise and outliers in the data as well as for partial geometric overlap,cs
the ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness of a dialogue system indeed this has been confirmed empirically on systems that utilise bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking however such systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more complex settings neural dialogue systems on the other hand rarely take uncertainties into account they are therefore overconfident in their decisions and less robust moreover the performance of the tracking task is often evaluated in isolation without consideration of its effect on the downstream policy optimisation we propose the use of different uncertainty measures in neural belief tracking the effects of these measures on the downstream task of policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with a user simulator both human and simulated user results show that incorporating these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the robustness of the downstream dialogue policy this highlights the importance of developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account,cs

the transition from arbitrary to chaotic fluctuation properties in quantum systems is studied in a random matrix model it is assumed that the hamiltonian can be written as the sum of an arbitrary and a chaos producing part the gaussian ensembles are used to model the chaotic part a closed integral representation for all correlations in the case of broken time reversal invariance is derived by employing supersymmetry and the graded eigenvalue method in particular the two level correlation function is expressed as a double integral for a correlation index exact diffusion equations are derived for all three universality classes which describe the transition to the chaotic regime from arbitrary initial conditions as an application the transition from poisson regularity to chaos is discussed the two level correlation function becomes a double integral for all values of the transition parameter,cond-mat
in the present work we investigate the effects of longrange interactions on the phase transitions of twodimensional ferromagnetic models with singleion anisotropy at zero and finite temperatures the hamiltonian is given by hsum_ineq j j_ijs_ixs_jxs_iys_jylambda s_izs_jzdsum_is_iz where j_ijj r_jr_ip pgeq is a longrange ferromagnetic interaction j leq lambdaleq is an anisotropic constant and d is the singleion anisotropic constant it is wellknown that the singleion anisotropy d creates a competition between an ordered state favored by the exchange interaction and a disordered state even at zero temperature for small values of d the system has a spontaneous magnetization m_zneq while in the larged phase m_z because a state with langle szrangleneq is energetically unfavorable therefore a phase transition due to quantum fluctuations occurs in some critical value d_c for systems with shortrange interaction d_capprox j depending of lambda constant but in our model we have found larger values of d due to the higher cost to flip a spin since lowdimensional magnetic systems with long range interaction can be ordered at finite temperature we also have analyzed the thermal phase transitions similar to the bkt transition the model has been studied by using a schwinger boson formalism as well as the selfconsistent harmonic approximation scha and both methods provide according results,cond-mat

the main objective for this research was the analytical exploration of the dynamics of planar satellite rotation during the motion of an elliptical orbit around a planet first we revisit the results of j wisdom et al in which by the elegant change of variables considering the true anomaly f as the independent variable the governing equation of satellite rotation takes the form of an abel ode of the second kind a sort of generalization of the riccati ode we note that due to the special character of solutions of a riccatitype ode there exists the possibility of sudden jumping in the magnitude of the solution at some moment of time in the physical sense this jumping of the riccatitype solutions of the governing ode could be associated with the effect of sudden accelerationdeceleration in the satellite rotation around the chosen principle axis at a definite moment of parametric time this means that there exists not only a chaotic satellite rotation regime as per the results of j wisdom et al but a kind of gradient catastrophe arnold could occur during the satellite rotation process we especially note that if a gradient catastrophe could occur this does not mean that it must occur such a possibility depends on the initial conditions in addition we obtained asymptotical solutions that manifest a quasiperiodic character even with the strong simplifying assumptions e p which reduce the governing equation of j wisdom et al to a kind of beletskii equation,physics

we consider periodical status updates between a transmitter and a legitimate receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper that is sometimes able to capture pieces of information we assume that in the absence of such a threat the connection between the transmitter and the receiver is controlled by the transmitter with the aim to minimize the age of information at the receivers side however if the presence of an eavesdropper is known the transmitter may further tune the generation rate of status updates to trade off the age of information values acquired by the eavesdropper and the receiver respectively to analyze this problem we first propose a metric that combines both objectives according to a bergson social welfare framework and then we solve the problem of finding the optimal generation rate as a function of the probability of data capture by the eavesdropper this enables us to derive notable and sometimes counterintuitive conclusions and possibly establish an extension of the age of information framework to security aspects from a performance evaluation perspective,cs

methylammonium lead iodide perovskites are considered direct bandgap semiconductors here we show that in fact they present a weakly indirect bandgap mev below the direct bandgap transition this is a consequence of spinorbit coupling resulting in rashbasplitting of the conduction band the indirect nature of the bandgap explains the apparent contradiction of strong absorption and long charge carrier lifetime under hydrostatic pressure from ambient to mpa rashba splitting is reduced due to a pressure induced ordering of the crystal structure the nature of the bandgap becomes increasingly more direct resulting in five times faster charge carrier recombination and a doubling of the radiative efficiency at hydrostatic pressures above mpa mapi undergoes a reversible phase transition resulting in a purely direct bandgap semiconductor the pressureinduced changes suggest epitaxial and synthetic routes to higher efficiency optoelectronic devices,cond-mat

an important capability of autonomous multirobot systems is to prevent collision among the individual robots one approach to this problem is to plan conflictfree trajectories and let each of the robots follow its preplanned trajectory a widely used practical method for multirobot trajectory planning is prioritized planning which has been shown to be effective in practice but is in general incomplete formal analysis of instances that are provably solvable by prioritized planning is still missing moreover prioritized planning is a centralized algorithm which may be in many situations undesirable in this paper we a propose a revised version of prioritized planning and characterize the class of instances that are provably solvable by the algorithm and b propose an asynchronous decentralized variant of prioritized planning which maintains the desirable properties of the centralized version and in the same time exploits the distributed computational power of the individual robots which in most situations allows to find the joint trajectories faster the experimental evaluation performed on realworld indoor maps shows that a the revised version of prioritized planning reliably solves a wide class of instances on which both classical prioritized planning and popular reactive technique orca fail and b the asynchronous decentralized algorithm provides solution faster than the previously proposed synchronized decentralized algorithm,cs

turntaking has played an essential role in structuring the regulation of a conversation the task of identifying the main speaker who is properly taking hisher turn of speaking and the interrupters who are interrupting or reacting to the main speakers utterances remains a challenging task although some prior methods have partially addressed this task there still remain some limitations firstly a direct association of audio and visual features may limit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities secondly the relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency of localization separation and conversation contexts is not effectively exploited finally the interactions between speakers that usually contain the tracking and anticipatory decisions about the transition to a new speaker are usually ignored therefore this work introduces a new audiovisual transformer approach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in both audio and visual channels of a multispeaker conversation video in the wild the proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in both visual and audio signals the temporal audiovisual relationships across spatialtemporal space are anticipated and optimized via the selfattention mechanism in a transformerstructure moreover a newly collected dataset is introduced for the main speaker detection to the best of our knowledge it is one of the first studies that is able to automatically localize and highlight the main speaker in both visual and audio channels in multispeaker conversation videos,cs

contemporary blockchain such as bitcoin and ethereum execute transactions serially by miners and validators and determine the proofofwork pow such serial execution is unable to exploit modern multicore resources efficiently hence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance latency the objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput by introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis technique we propose a framework dipetrans for the distributed execution of the transactions in a block here peers in the blockchain network form a community to execute the transactions and find the pow parallelly using a leaderfollower approach during mining the leader statically analyzes the transactions creates different groups shards of independent transactions and distributes them to followers to execute them in parallel after the transaction executes the communitys compute power is utilized to solve the pow concurrently when a block is successfully created the leader broadcasts the proposed block to other peers in the network for validation on receiving a block validators reexecute the block transactions and accept the block if they reach the same state as shared by the miner validation can also be done as a community in parallel following the same leaderfollower approach as mining we report experiments using over million real transactions from the ethereum blockchain and execute them using our dipetrans framework to empirically validate the benefits of our techniques over traditional sequential execution we achieve a maximum speedup of x for the miner and x for the validator with to transactions per block further we achieve a peak of x endtoend block creation speedup using a parallel miner over a serial miner when using machines in the community,cs

geographical information systems are ideal candidates for the application of parallel programming techniques mainly because they usually handle large data sets to help us deal with complex calculations over such data sets we investigated the performance constraints of a classic masterworker parallel paradigm over a messagepassing communication model to this end we present a new approach that employs an external database in order to improve the calculationcommunication overlap thus reducing the idle times for the worker processes the presented approach is implemented as part of a parallel radiocoverage prediction tool for the grass environment the prediction calculation employs digital elevation models and landusage data in order to analyze the radio coverage of a geographical area we provide an extended analysis of the experimental results which are based on real data from an lte network currently deployed in slovenia based on the results of the experiments which were performed on a computer cluster the new approach exhibits better scalability than the traditional masterworker approach we successfully tackled realworld data sets while greatly reducing the processing time and saturating the hardware utilization,cs
we study the excitation of density and bending waves and the associated angular momentum transfer in gaseous disks with finite thickness by a rotating external potential the disk is assumed to be isothermal in the vertical direction and has no selfgravity the disk perturbations are decomposed into different modes each characterized by the azimuthal index m and the vertical index n which specifies the nodal number of the density perturbation along the disk normal direction the n modes correspond to the twodimensional density waves previously studied by goldreich tremaine and others in a threedimensional disk waves can be excited at both lindblad resonances for modes with n and vertical resonances for the nge modes only the torque on the disk is positive for waves excited at outer linbladvertical resonances and negative at inner lindbladvertical resonances while the n modes are evanescent around corotation the nge modes can propagate into the corotation region where they are damped and deposit their angular momenta we have derived analytical expressions for the amplitudes of different wave modes excited at lindblad andor vertical resonances and the resulting torques on the disk it is found that for nge angular momentum transfer through vertical resonances is much more efficient than lindblad resonances this implies that in some situations eg a circumstellar disk perturbed by a planet in an inclined orbit vertical resonances may be an important channel of angular momentum transfer between the disk and the external potential we have also derived new formulae for the angular momentum deposition at corotation and studied wave excitations at disk boundaries,astro-ph

we consider an ionic fluid made with two species of mobile particles carrying either a positive or a negative charge we derive a sum rule for the fourth moment of equilibrium charge correlations our method relies on the study of the system response to the potential created by a weak external charge distribution with slow spatial variations the induced particle densities and the resulting induced charge density are then computed within density functional theory where the free energy is expanded in powers of the density gradients the comparison with the predictions of linear response theory provides a thermodynamical expression for the fourth moment of charge correlations which involves the isothermal compressibility as well as suitably defined partial compressibilities the familiar stillingerlovett condition is also recovered as a byproduct of our method suggesting that the fourth moment sum rule should hold in any conducting phase this is explicitly checked in the low density regime within the abemeeron diagrammatical expansions beyond its own interest the fourthmoment sum rule should be useful for both analyzing and understanding recently observed behaviours near the ionic critical point,cond-mat
the concept of time series irreversibility the degree by which the statistics of signals are not invariant under time reversal naturally appears in nonequilibrium physics in stationary systems which operate away from equilibrium and produce entropy this concept has not been explored to date in the realm of musical scores as these are typically short sequences whose time reversibility estimation could suffer from strong finite size effects which preclude interpretability here we show that the socalled horizontal visibility graph method which recently was shown to quantify such statistical property even in nonstationary signals is a method that can estimate time reversibility of short symbolic sequences thus unlocking the possibility of exploring such properties in the context of musical compositions accordingly we analyse over musical pieces ranging from the renaissance to the early modern period and certify that indeed most of them display clear signatures of time irreversibility since by construction stochastic processes with a linear correlation structure such as f noise are time reversible we conclude that musical compositions have a considerably richer structure that goes beyond the traditional properties retrieved by the power spectrum or similar approaches we also show that musical compositions display strong signs of nonlinear correlations that nonlinearity is correlated to irreversibility and that these are also related to asymmetries in the abundance of musical intervals which we associate to the narrative underpinning a musical composition these findings provide tools for the study of musical periods and composers as well as criteria related to music appreciation and cognition,physics

recent results suggest that attacks against supervised machine learning systems are quite effective while defenses are easily bypassed by new attacks however the specifications for machine learning systems currently lack precise adversary definitions and the existing attacks make diverse potentially unrealistic assumptions about the strength of the adversary who launches them we propose the fail attacker model which describes the adversarys knowledge and control along four dimensions our model allows us to consider a wide range of weaker adversaries who have limited control and incomplete knowledge of the features learning algorithms and training instances utilized to evaluate the utility of the fail model we consider the problem of conducting targeted poisoning attacks in a realistic setting the crafted poison samples must have clean labels must be individually and collectively inconspicuous and must exhibit a generalized form of transferability defined by the fail model by taking these constraints into account we design stingray a targeted poisoning attack that is practical against machine learning applications which use different learning algorithms and can bypass existing defenses conversely we show that a prior evasion attack is less effective under generalized transferability such attack evaluations under the fail adversary model may also suggest promising directions for future defenses,cs

using the tight binding model and the nonequilibrium green function method we study andreev reflection in graphenesuperconductor junction where graphene has two nonequal dirac cones split in energy and therefore time reversal symmetry is broken due to the antichiral edge states of the current graphene model an incident electron travelling along the edges makes distinct contribution to andreev reflections in a twoterminal device because andreev retroreflection is not allowed for just the antichiral edges in this case the mutual scattering between edge and bulk states is necessary which leads that the coefficient of andreev retroreflection is always symmetrical about the incident energy in a fourterminal junction however the edges are parallel to the interface of superconductor and graphene so at the interface an incident electron travelling along the edges can be retroreflected as a hole into bulk modes or specularly reflected as a hole into antichiral edge states again it is noted that the coefficient of specular andreev reflection keeps symmetric as to the incident energy of electron which is consistent with the reported results before however the coefficient of andreev retroreflection shows an unexpected asymmetrical behavior due to the presence of antichiral edge states our results present some new ideas to study the antichiral edge modes and andreev reflection for a graphene model with the broken time reversal symmetry,cond-mat

we analyze the colors and sizes of quiescent uvjselected galaxies with strong balmer absorption mboxewhdelta geq aa at zsim drawn from dr of the legac survey to test the hypothesis that these galaxies experienced compact central starbursts before quenching these recently quenched galaxies usually referred to as poststarburst galaxies span a wide range of colors and we find a clear correlation between color and halflight radius such that bluer galaxies are smaller we build simple toy models to explain this correlation a normal starforming disk plus a central compact starburst component bursts with exponential decay timescale of sim myr that produce sim to more than of the preexisting masses can reproduce the observed correlation more significant bursts also produce bluer and smaller descendants our findings imply that when galaxies shut down star formation rapidly they generally had experienced compact starburst events and that the large observed spread in sizes and colors mostly reflects a variety of burst strengths recently quenched galaxies should have younger stellar ages in the centers multiwavelength data with high spatial resolution are required to reveal the age gradient highly dissipative processes should be responsible for this type of formation history while determining the mechanisms for individual galaxies is challenging some recently quenched galaxies show signs of gravitational interactions suggesting that mergers are likely an important mechanism in triggering the rapid shutdown of starformation activities at zsim,astro-ph

while allostery is of paramount importance for protein regulation the underlying dynamical process of ligand unbinding at one site resulting time evolution of the protein structure and change of the binding affinity at a remote site is not well understood here the ligandinduced conformational transition in a widely studied model system of allostery the pdz domain is investigated by transient infrared spectroscopy accompanied by molecular dynamics simulations to this end an azobenzene derived photoswitch is linked to a peptide ligand in a way that its binding affinity to the pdz domain changes upon switching thus initiating an allosteric transition in the pdz domain protein the subsequent response of the protein covering four decades of time ranging from simns to simmus can be rationalize by a remodelling of its rugged free energy landscape with ver subtle shifts in the populations of a small number of structurally well defined states it is proposed that structurally and dynamically driven allostery often discussed as limiting scenarios of allosteric communication actually go handinhand allowing the protein to adapt its free energy landscape to incoming signals,physics
selfregulating agn feedback in the cool cores of galaxy clusters plays central role in solving the decadesold cooling flow problem but one major problem remains unsolved how is the agn energy thermalized in the icm and what are the effective black hole feeding rates in realistic systems we perform a suite of d mhd amr simulations of agn feedback in a cool core cluster including cosmic ray cr physics crs are supplied to the icm via collimated agn jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized icm via streaming and interact with the icm via hadronic coulomb and streaming instability heating we find that cr transport is an essential model ingredient needed for agn feedback to selfregulate at least within the context of the physical model considered here when cr streaming is neglected the suppression of cr mixing with the icm by magnetic fields significantly reduces icm heating which leads to cooling catastrophes in the opposite case crs come into contact with the ambient icm and efficiently heat it which results in globally stable atmospheres moreover the dynamical state and intermittency of the central agn are dramatically altered when cr streaming is present we find that cr streaming heating dominates over the heating due to coulomb and hadronic processes importantly in simulations that include cr streaming cr pressure support in the central kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate observational constraints on the contrary when cr streaming is neglected cr energy is not spent on the icm heating and cr pressure builds up to the level that is in disagreement with the data overall our models demonstrate that cr heating is a viable channel for the thermalization of agn energy in clusters and likely also in elliptical galaxies and that crs play an important role in determining agn intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres,astro-ph

in evaluating the number of technological civilizations n in the galaxy through the drake formula emphasis is mostly put on the astrophysical and biotechnological factors describing the emergence of a civilization and much less on its the lifetime which is intimately related to its demise it is argued here that this factor is in fact the most important regarding the practical implications of the drake formula because it determines the maximal extent of the sphere of influence of any technological civilization the fermi paradox is studied in the terms of a simplified version of the drake formula through monte carlo simulations of n civilizations expanding in the galaxy during their space faring lifetime l in the framework of that scheme the probability of direct contact is determined as the fraction of the galactic volume occupied collectively by the spheres of influence of n civilizations the results of the analysis are used to determine regions in the parameter space where the fermi paradox holds it is argued that in a large region of the diagram the corresponding parameters suggest rather a weak fermi paradox future research may reveal whether a strong paradox holds in some part of the parameter space finally it is argued that the value of n is not bound by n from below contrary to what is usually assumed but it may have a statistical interpretation,physics

magnetic susceptibility chi and v nmr have been measured in v_xti_x_o_ near the phase boundary of the metalinsulator transition it is established that the transition from antiferromagnetic insulating afi to antiferromagnetic metallic phases near x_rm capprox is not quantum critical but is discontinuous with a jump of the transition temperature in the afi phase at k we observed the satellite in the zerofield v nmr spectrum around mhz in addition to the host resonance around mhz the satellite is also observable in the paramagnetic metallic phase of the x sample we associated the satellite with the v sites near ti which are in the vlike oxidation state but has different temperature dependence of the nmr shift from that of the host v site the host dspin susceptibility for x decreases below sim k but remains finite in the lowtemperature limit,cond-mat

in this paper a novel framework is proposed for optimizing the operation and performance of a largescale multihop millimeter wave mmw backhaul within a wireless small cell network scn that encompasses multiple mobile network operators mnos the proposed framework enables the small base stations sbss to jointly decide on forming the multihop mmw links over backhaul infrastructure that belongs to multiple independent mnos while properly allocating resources across those links in this regard the problem is addressed using a novel framework based on matching theory that is composed to two highly interrelated stages a multihop network formation stage and a resource management stage one unique feature of this framework is that it jointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors during both network formation and resource management the multihop network formation stage is formulated as a onetomany matching game which is solved using a novel algorithm that builds on the socalled deferred acceptance algorithm and is shown to yield a stable and pareto optimal multihop mmw backhaul network then a onetomany matching game is formulated to enable proper resource allocation across the formed multihop network this game is then shown to exhibit peer effects and as such a novel algorithm is developed to find a stable and optimal resource management solution that can properly cope with these peer effects simulation results show that the proposed framework yields substantial gains in terms of the average sum rate reaching up to and respectively compared to a noncooperative scheme in which interoperator sharing is not allowed and a random allocation approach the results also show that our framework provides insights on how to manage pricing and the cost of the cooperative mmw backhaul network for the mnos,cs
