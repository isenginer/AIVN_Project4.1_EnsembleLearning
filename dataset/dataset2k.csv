the influence that the kinematics of pitching and heaving d airfoils have on the aerodynamic forces is investigated using direct numerical simulations and a force decomposition algorithm large amplitude motions are considered of the order of one chord with moderate reynolds numbers and reduced frequencies of order varying the mean pitch angle and the phase shift between the pitching and heaving motions our results show that the surface vorticity contribution viscous effects to the aerodynamic force is negligible compared to the contributions from the body motion fluid inertia and the vorticity within the flow circulation for the range of parameters considered here the latter tends to be instantaneously oriented in the direction normal to the chord of the airfoil based on the results discussed in the paper a reduced order model for the instantaneous aerodynamic force is proposed taking advantage of the force decomposition and the chordnormal orientation of the contribution from vorticity within the flow to the total aerodynamic force the predictions of the proposed model are compared to those of a similar model from the literature showing a noticeable improvement on the prediction of the mean thrust and a smaller improvement on the prediction of mean lift and the instantaneous force coefficients,physics
we address the problem of evaluating the transfer entropy te produced by biochemical reactions from experimentally measured data although these reactions are generally nonlinear and nonstationary processes making it challenging to achieve accurate modeling gaussian approximation can facilitate the te assessment only by estimating covariance matrices using multiple data obtained from simultaneously measured time series representing the activation levels of biomolecules such as proteins nevertheless the nonstationary nature of biochemical signals makes it difficult to theoretically assess the sampling distributions of te which are necessary for evaluating the statistical confidence and significance of the datadriven estimates we resolve this difficulty by computationally assessing the sampling distributions using techniques from computational statistics the computational methods are tested by using them in analyzing data generated from a theoretically tractable timevarying signal model which leads to the development of a method to screen only statistically significant estimates the usefulness of the developed method is examined by applying it to real biological data experimentally measured from the erbbrasmapk system that superintends diverse cell fate decisions a comparison between cells containing wildtype and mutant proteins exhibits a distinct difference in the time evolution of te while apparent difference is hardly found in average profiles of the raw signals such comparison may help in unveiling important pathways of biochemical reactions,physics

sessionbased recommendation is a challenging problem in the realworld scenes eg ecommerce short video platforms and music platforms which aims to predict the next click action based on the anonymous session recently graph neural networks gnns have emerged as the stateoftheart methods for sessionbased recommendation however we find that there exist two limitations in these methods one is the item transition relations are not fully exploited since the relations are not explicitly modeled another is the longrange dependencies between items can not be captured effectively due to the limitation of gnns to solve the above problems we propose a novel approach for sessionbased recommendation called transition relation aware selfattention trasa specifically trasa first converts the session to a graph and then encodes the shortest path between items through the gated recurrent unit as their transition relation then to capture the longrange dependencies trasa utilizes the selfattention mechanism to build the direct connection between any two items without going through intermediate ones also the transition relations are incorporated explicitly when computing the attention scores extensive experiments on three realword datasets demonstrate that trasa outperforms the existing stateoftheart methods consistently,cs
the exponential family is well known in machine learning and statistical physics as the maximum entropy distribution subject to a set of observed constraints while the geometric mixture path is common in mcmc methods such as annealed importance sampling linking these two ideas recent work has interpreted the geometric mixture path as an exponential family of distributions to analyze the thermodynamic variational objective tvo we extend these likelihood ratio exponential families to include solutions to ratedistortion rd optimization the information bottleneck ib method and recent ratedistortionclassification approaches which combine rd and ib this provides a common mathematical framework for understanding these methods via the conjugate duality of exponential families and hypothesis testing further we collect existing results to provide a variational representation of intermediate rd or tvo distributions as a minimizing an expectation of kl divergences this solution also corresponds to a sizepower tradeoff using the likelihood ratio test and the neyman pearson lemma in thermodynamic integration bounds such as the tvo we identify the intermediate distribution whose expected sufficient statistics match the log partition function,cs

historically longslit spectroscopic observations were carried out using the parallactic angle for the slit orientation if slit loss was an important consideration either to maximize the signaltonoise or to do spectrophotometry this requires periodic realignment of the slit position angle as the parallactic angle changes this is not possible for multislit observations where one slit position angle must be chosen for the entire exposure common wisdom suggests using the parallactic angle at the meridian ha in this paper i examine what the best strategy is for long multislit exposures i find that in extreme cases very long exposure time the best choice is to orient the slit emphperpendicular to the parallactic angle at the meridian there are two effects to consider the increasing dispersion with increasing airmass and the changing angle between the parallactic angle and the slit in the case of emphtraditional slit orientation the two effects amplify each other thus rendering a significant fraction of the observation useless using the perpendicular orientation the two processes work against each other thus most of the observation remains useful i will use as an example our hour lockman hole observations using the keck telescope but generic methods are given to evaluate a particular observation i also make the tools available to the community,astro-ph

hydrodynamic memory force or basset force is known since the thcentury its influence on brownian motion remains however mostly unexplored here we investigate its role in nonlinear transport and diffusion within a paradigmatic model of tilted washboard potential in this model a giant enhancement of driven diffusion over its potentialfree limit presents a wellestablished paradoxical phenomenon in the overdamped limit it occurs at a critical tilt of vanishing potential barriers however for weak damping it takes place surprisingly at another critical tilt where the potential barriers are clearly expressed recently we showed that basset force could make such a diffusion enhancement enormously large in this paper we discover that even for moderately strong damping where the overdamped theory works very well when the memory effects are negligible substantial hydrodynamic memory unexpectedly makes a strong impact first the diffusion boost occurs at nonvanishing potential barriers and can be orders of magnitude larger second transient anomalous diffusion regimes emerge over many time decades and potential periods third particles mobility can also be dramatically enhanced and a long transient supertransport regime emerges,cond-mat

shapelets that discriminate time series using local features subsequences are promising for time series clustering existing time series clustering methods may fail to capture representative shapelets because they discover shapelets from a large pool of uninformative subsequences and thus result in low clustering accuracy this paper proposes a semisupervised clustering of time series using representative shapelets ssshapelets method which utilizes a small number of labeled and propagated pseudolabeled time series to help discover representative shapelets thereby improving the clustering accuracy in ssshapelets we propose two techniques to discover representative shapelets for the effective clustering of time series a textitsalient subsequence chain ssc that can extract salient subsequences as candidate shapelets of a labeledpseudolabeled time series which helps remove massive uninformative subsequences from the pool a textitlinear discriminant selection lds algorithm to identify shapelets that can capture representative local features of time series in different classes for convenient clustering experiments on ucr time series datasets demonstrate that ssshapelets discovers representative shapelets and achieves higher clustering accuracy than counterpart semisupervised time series clustering methods,cs
deep reinforcement learning agents have recently been successful across a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks however they can be slow to train and require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn a suitable policy this is borne out by the fact that a reinforcement learning agent has no prior knowledge of the world no preexisting data to depend on and so must devote considerable time to exploration transfer learning can alleviate some of the problems by leveraging learning done on some source task to help learning on some target task our work presents an algorithm for initialising the hidden feature representation of the target task we propose a domain adaptation method to transfer state representations and demonstrate transfer across domains tasks and action spaces we utilise adversarial domain adaptation ideas combined with an adversarial autoencoder architecture we align our new policies representation space with a pretrained source policy taking target task data generated from a random policy we demonstrate that this initialisation step provides significant improvement when learning a new reinforcement learning task which highlights the wide applicability of adversarial adaptation methods even as the task and labelaction space also changes,cs

in modern science the efficient numerical treatment of highdimensional problems becomes more and more important a fundamental insight of the theory of informationbased complexity ibc for short is that the computational hardness of a problem can not be described properly only by the rate of convergence there exist problems for which an exponential number of information operations is needed in order to reduce the initial error although there are algorithms which provide an arbitrary large rate of convergence problems that yield this exponential dependence are said to suffer from the curse of dimensionality while analyzing numerical problems it turns out that we can often vanquish this curse by exploiting additional structural properties the aim of this thesis is to present several approaches of this type moreover a detailed introduction to the field of ibc is given,math
knowledge of the mechanisms of interaction between selfaggregating peptides and nucleic acids or other polyanions is key to the understanding of many aggregation processes underlying several human diseases eg alzheimers and parkinsons diseases determining the affinity and kinetic steps of such interactions is challenging due to the competition between hydrophobic selfaggregating forces and electrostatic binding forces kahalalide f kf is an anticancer hydrophobic peptide which contains a single positive charge that confers strong aggregative properties with polyanions this makes kf an ideal model to elucidate the mechanisms by which selfaggregation competes with binding to a strongly charged polyelectrolyte such as dna we use optical tweezers to apply mechanical forces to single dna molecules and show that kf and dna interact in a twostep kinetic process promoted by the electrostatic binding of dna to the aggregate surface followed by the stabilization of the complex due to hydrophobic interactions from the measured pulling curves we determine the spectrum of binding affinities kinetic barriers and lengths of dna segments sequestered within the kfdna complex we find there is a capture distance beyond which the complex collapses into compact aggregates stabilized by strong hydrophobic forces and discuss how the bending rigidity of the nucleic acid affects such process we hypothesize that within an in vivo context the enhanced electrostatic interaction of kf due to its aggregation might mediate the binding to other polyanions the proposed methodology should be useful to quantitatively characterize other compounds or proteins in which the formation of aggregates is relevant,physics

deep neural networks have achieved tremendous success due to their representation power and adaptation to lowdimensional structures their potential for estimating structured regression functions has been recently established in the literature however most of the studies require the input dimension to be fixed and consequently ignore the effect of dimension on the rate of convergence and hamper their applications to modern big data with high dimensionality in this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing a kth order nonparametric interaction model in both growing dimension scenarios d grows with n but at a slower rate and in high dimension d gtrsim n in the latter case sparsity assumptions and associated regularization are required in order to obtain optimal rates of convergence a new challenge in diverging dimension setting is in calculation meansquare error the covariance terms among estimated additive components are an order of magnitude larger than those of the variances and they can deteriorate statistical properties without proper care we introduce a critical debiasing technique to amend the problem we show that under certain standard assumptions debiased deep neural networks achieve a minimax optimal rate both in terms of n d our proof techniques rely crucially on a novel debiasing technique that makes the covariances of additive components negligible in the meansquare error calculation in addition we establish the matching lower bounds,math

the nearby grb sn aj was an extremely long weak and very soft grb it was peculiar in many aspects we show here that the xray ultravioletoptical and radio afterglow of grb have to be attributed to different physical processes arising from different emission regions from the several components in this bursts afterglow only the radio afterglow can be interpreted in terms of the common external shock model we infer from the radio that the blast waves kinetic energy was sim erg and the circumburst matter had a constant rather than a wind profile the lack of a jet break up to days implies that the outflow was wide theta_j even though the late xray afterglow decays normally it cannot result from an external shock because of its very steep spectrum furthermore the implied kinetic energy would have produced far too much radio we suggest that this xray afterglow could be attributed to a continued activity of the central engine that within the collapsar scenario could arise from fallback accretion central engine afterglow may be common in underluminous grbs where the kinetic energy of the blast wave is small and the external shock does not dominate over this component such underluminous grbs might be very common but they are rarely recorded because they can be detected only from short distances,astro-ph

the mechanisms involved in the polarization switching process in soft and hard pbzr tio pzt bulk ceramics were investigated through the dependency of the hysteresis loop on the frequency in order to determine the influence of the defects on the domain switching dynamics the samples were characterized in the virgin state and after a fatigue or a depinning process the frequency dependence of the polarization revealed a strong relaxation of the domain walls at hz the results also revealed a strong influence of the kind of defect and their distribution into the ferroelectric matrix on the domain switching dynamics which reflected in the frequency dependence of the coercive field and the percentage of the backswitching initially it was observed that the frequency dependence of the coercive field for the soft and the hard pzt in the virgin state had just one rate of change per decade in all frequency range investigated which is the standard behavior found in the literature however after the fatigue or the depinning process two rates of changes were noticed consequently an evidence of an upper frequency limit for the coercive field changes was found the percentage of the backswitching and its behavior for the soft pzt was almost independent of the fatigue state in all frequency range investigated nevertheless for the hard pzt an opposite behavior was verified the reorientation of the domains was modeled as occurring in a viscous medium where several forces such as viscous and restoring forces act on them,cond-mat
the huge size of the widely used bert family models has led to recent efforts about model distillation the main goal of distillation is to create a taskagnostic pretrained model that can be finetuned on downstream tasks without finetuning its fullsized version despite the progress of distillation to what degree and for what reason a taskagnostic model can be created from distillation has not been well studied also the mechanisms behind transfer learning of those bert models are not well investigated either therefore this work focuses on analyzing the acceptable deduction when distillation for guiding the future distillation procedure specifically we first inspect the prunability of the transformer heads in roberta and albert using their head importance estimation proposed by michel et al and then check the coherence of the important heads between the pretrained task and downstream tasks hence the acceptable deduction of performance on the pretrained task when distilling a model can be derived from the results and we further compare the behavior of the pruned model before and after finetuning our studies provide guidance for future directions about bert family model distillation,cs

a traditional assumption underlying most data converters is that the signal should be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency this statement is based on a worstcase scenario in which the signal occupies the entire available bandwidth in practice many signals are sparse so that only part of the bandwidth is used in this paper we develop methods for lowrate sampling of continuoustime sparse signals in shiftinvariant si spaces generated by m kernels with period t we model sparsity by treating the case in which only k out of the m generators are active however we do not know which k are chosen we show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than mt which is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity our approach combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite counterpart using these two components we formulate our problem within the framework of finite compressed sensing cs and then rely on algorithms developed in that context the distinguishing feature of our results is that in contrast to standard cs which treats finitelength vectors we consider sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finitedimensional model exists the proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature on cs to the analog domain,cs

solving l regularized optimization problems is common in the fields of computational biology signal processing and machine learning such l regularization is utilized to find sparse minimizers of convex functions a wellknown example is the lasso problem where the l norm regularizes a quadratic function a multilevel framework is presented for solving such l regularized sparse optimization problems efficiently we take advantage of the expected sparseness of the solution and create a hierarchy of problems of similar type which is traversed in order to accelerate the optimization process this framework is applied for solving two problems the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem and lregularized logistic regression in the first problem the inverse of an unknown covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution is estimated under the assumption that it is sparse to this end an l regularized logdeterminant optimization problem needs to be solved this task is challenging especially for largescale datasets due to time and memory limitations in the second problem the lregularization is added to the logistic regression classification objective to reduce overfitting to the data and obtain a sparse model numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the multilevel framework in accelerating existing iterative solvers for both of these problems,cs

it is almost always easier to find an accuratebutcomplex model than an accurateyetsimple model finding optimal sparse accurate models of various forms linear models with integer coefficients decision sets rule lists decision trees is generally nphard we often do not know whether the search for a simpler model will be worthwhile and thus we do not go to the trouble of searching for one in this work we ask an important practical question can accurateyetsimple models be proven to exist or shown likely to exist before explicitly searching for them we hypothesize that there is an important reason that simpleyetaccurate models often do exist this hypothesis is that the size of the rashomon set is often large where the rashomon set is the set of almostequallyaccurate models from a function class if the rashomon set is large it contains numerous accurate models and perhaps at least one of them is the simple model we desire in this work we formally present the rashomon ratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem depending on a function class and a data set the rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space and it is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory insight from studying the rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check whether a simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it namely whether several different machine learning methods achieve similar performance on the data in that sense the rashomon ratio is a powerful tool for understanding why and when an accurateyetsimple model might exist if as we hypothesize in this work many realworld data sets admit large rashomon sets the implications are vast it means that simple or interpretable models may often be used for highstakes decisions without losing accuracy,cs

we present the pol mum linear polarization map of the barnard clump in the perseus molecular cloud complex from the bfields in starforming region observations bistro survey at the james clerk maxwell telescope we find a trend of decreasing polarization fraction as a function of total intensity which we link to depolarization effects towards higher density regions of the cloud we then use the polarization data at mum to infer the planeofsky orientation of the largescale magnetic field in barnard this magnetic field runs northsouth across most of the cloud with the exception of bc where it turns more eastwest from the dispersion of polarization angles we calculate a turbulence correlation length of pm arcsec au and a turbulenttototal magnetic energy ratio of pm inside the cloud we combine this turbulenttototal magnetic energy ratio with observations of nh_ molecular lines from the green bank ammonia survey gas to estimate the strength of the planeofsky component of the magnetic field through the davischandrasekharfermi method with a planeofsky amplitude of pm mug and a criticality criterion lambda_c pm we find that barnard is a supercritical molecular cloud with a magnetic field nearly dominated by its turbulent component,astro-ph
extracting times of arrival from pulsar radio signals depends on the knowledge of the pulsars pulse profile and how this template is generated we examine pulsar template generation with bayesian methods we will contrast the classical generation mechanism of averaging intensity profiles with a new approach based on bayesian inference we introduce the bayesian measurement model imposed and derive the algorithm to reconstruct a statistical template out of noisy data the properties of these statistical templates are analysed with simulated and real measurement data from psr b we explain how to put this new form of template to use in analysing secondary parameters of interest and give various examples we implement a nonlinear filter for determining toas of pulsars applying this method to data from psr j we derive toas self consistently meaning all epochs were timed and we used the same epochs for template generation while the average template contains fluctuations and noise as unavoidable artifacts we find that the statistical template derived by bayesian inference quantifies fluctuations and remaining uncertainty this is why the algorithm suggested turns out to reconstruct templates of statistical significance from ten to fifty single pulses a moving data window of fifty pulses taking out one single pulse at the beginning and adding one at the end of the window unravels the characteristics of the methods to be compared it shows that the change induced in the classical reconstruction is dominated by random fluctuations for the average template while statistically significant changes drive the dynamics of the proposed methods reconstruction the analysis of phase shifts with simulated data reveals that the proposed nonlinear algorithm is able to reconstruct correct phase information along with an acceptable estimation of the remaining uncertainty,astro-ph

this paper explores the effects of strong magnetic fields on the compton scattering of relativistic electrons recent studies of upscattering and energy loss by relativistic electrons that have used the nonrelativistic magnetic thomson cross section for resonant scattering or the kleinnishina cross section for nonresonant scattering do not account for the relativistic quantum effects of strong fields times g we have derived a simplified expression for the exact qed scattering cross section for the broadlyapplicable case where relativistic electrons move along the magnetic field to facilitate applications to astrophysical models we have also developed compact approximate expressions for both the differential and total polarizationdependent cross sections with the latter representing well the exact total qed cross section even at the high fields believed to be present in environments near the stellar surfaces of soft gammaray repeaters and anomalous xray pulsars we find that strong magnetic fields significantly lower the compton scattering cross section below and at the resonance when the incident photon energy exceeds m_ec in the electron rest frame the cross section is strongly dependent on the polarization of the final scattered photon below the cyclotron fundamental mostly photons of perpendicular polarization are produced in scatterings a situation that also arises above this resonance for subcritical fields however an interesting discovery is that for supercritical fields a preponderance of photons of parallel polarization results from scatterings above the cyclotron fundamental this characteristic is both a relativistic and magnetic effect not present in the thomson or kleinnishina limits,astro-ph

we show that the local observables of the curved beta gamma system encode the sheaf of chiral differential operators using the machinery of the book factorization algebras in quantum field theory by kevin costello and the second author which combines renormalization the batalinvilkovisky formalism and factorization algebras our approach is in the spirit of deformation quantization via gelfandkazhdan formal geometry we begin by constructing a quantization of the beta gamma system with an ndimensional formal disk as the target there is an obstruction to quantizing equivariantly with respect to the action of formal vector fields on the target disk and it is naturally identified with the first pontryagin class in gelfandfuks cohomology any trivialization of the obstruction cocycle thus yields an equivariant quantization with respect to an extension of formal vector fields by the closed forms on the disk by results in the book listed above we then naturally obtain a factorization algebra of quantum observables which has an associated vertex algebra easily identified with the formal beta gamma vertex algebra next we introduce a version of gelfandkazhdan formal geometry suitable for factorization algebras and we verify that for a complex manifold with trivialized first pontryagin class the associated factorization algebra recovers the vertex algebra of cdos on the complex manifold,math

matching corresponding features between two images is a fundamental task to computer vision with numerous applications in object recognition robotics and d reconstruction current state of the art in image feature matching has focused on establishing a single consistency in static scenes by contrast finding multiple consistencies in dynamic scenes has been underresearched in this paper we present an endtoend optimization framework named iterative clustering with gametheoretic matching icgtm for robust multiconsistency correspondence the key idea is to formulate multiconsistency matching as a generalized clustering problem for an image pair in our formulation several local matching games are simultaneously carried out in different corresponding block pairs under the guidance of a novel payoff function consisting of both geometric and descriptive compatibility the global matching results are further iteratively refined by clustering and thresholding with respect to a payoff matrix we also propose three new metrics for evaluating the performance of multiconsistency image feature matching extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms previous stateoftheart approaches on both singleconsistency and multiconsistency datasets,cs
electromagnetic waves follow linear paths in homogenous index media with the exception of band edges in this study we introduced spatially distorted photonic crystals dpcs that are capable of beamsteering light waves even when a homogeneous refractive index is maintained we analyzed their equifrequency contours to investigate the correspondence between the direction of distortion and the direction of the group velocity vector in the dpc thereafter we experimentally verified the beamsteering phenomenon in the terahertz range using an allsilicon dpc our structures serve as onchip beam trajectory control without the need for any speciallyengineered materials using only lattice distortion,physics
we introduce the notion of a semiriemannian spectral triple which generalizes the notion of spectral triple and allows for a treatment of semiriemannian manifolds within a noncommutative setting it turns out that the relevant spaces in noncommutative semiriemannian geometry are not hilbert spaces any more but krein spaces and dirac operators are kreinselfadjoint we show that the noncommutative tori can be endowed with a semiriemannian structure in this way for the noncommutative tori as well as for semiriemannian spin manifolds the dimension the signature of the metric and the integral of a function can be recovered from the spectral data,math-ph
the most widelystudied mechanism of mass loss from extrasolar planets is photoevaporation via xuv ionization primarily in the context of highly irradiated planets however the euv dissociation of hydrogen molecules can also theoretically drive atmospheric evaporation on lowmass planets for temperate planets such as the early earth impact erosion is expected to dominate in the traditional planetesimal accretion model but it would be greatly reduced in pebble accretion scenarios allowing other mass loss processes to be major contributors we apply the same prescription for photoionization to this photodissociation mechanism and compare it to an analysis of other possible sources of mass loss in pebble accretion scenarios we find that there is not a clear path to evaporating the primordial atmosphere accreted by an early earth analog in a pebble accretion scenario impact erosion could remove bars of hydrogen if of the planets mass is accreted as planetesimals while the combined photoevaporation processes could evaporate bars of hydrogen photodissociation is likely a subdominant but significant component of mass loss similar results apply to superearths and minineptunes this mechanism could also preferentially remove hydrogen from a planets primordial atmosphere thereby leaving a larger abundance of primordial water compared to standard dry formation models we discuss the implications of these results for models of rocky planet formation including earths formation and the possible application of this analysis to mass loss from observed exoplanets,astro-ph

in newcombs paradox you choose to receive either the contents of a particular closed box or the contents of both that closed box and another one before you choose though an antagonist uses a prediction algorithm to deduce your choice and fills the two boxes based on that deduction newcombs paradox is that game theorys expected utility and dominance principles appear to provide conflicting recommendations for what you should choose a recent extension of game theory provides a powerful tool for resolving paradoxes concerning human choice which formulates such paradoxes in terms of bayes nets here we apply this to ol to newcombs scenario we show that the conflicting recommendations in newcombs scenario use different bayes nets to relate your choice and the algorithms prediction these two bayes nets are incompatible this resolves the paradox the reason there appears to be two conflicting recommendations is that the specification of the underlying bayes net is open to two conflicting interpretations we then show that the accuracy of the prediction algorithm in newcombs paradox the focus of much previous work is irrelevant we similarly show that the utility functions of you and the antagonist are irrelevant we end by showing that newcombs paradox is timereversal invariant both the paradox and its resolution are unchanged if the algorithm makes its prediction emphafter you make your choice rather than before,cs

in contrast to most other galaxies starformation rates in the milky way can be estimated directly from young stellar objects ysos in the central molecular zone cmz the starformation rate calculated from the number of ysos with microns emission is up to order of magnitude higher than the value estimated from methods based on diffuse emission such as freefree emission whether this effect is real or whether it indicates problems with either or both star formation rate measures is not currently known in this paper we investigate whether estimates based on ysos could be heavily contaminated by more evolved objects such as mainsequence stars we present radiative transfer models of ysos and of mainsequence stars in a constant ambient medium which show that the mainsequence objects can indeed mimic ysos at microns however we show that in some cases the mainsequence models can be marginally resolved at microns whereas the yso models are always unresolved based on the fraction of resolved mips microns sources in the sample of ysos previously used to compute the star formation rate we estimate the fraction of misclassified ysos to be at least which suggests that the starformation rate previously determined from ysos is likely to be at least a factor of three too high,astro-ph

the unsteady hydrodynamics of two inphase pitching foils arranged in sidebyside parallel configurations is examined for a range of strouhal number and separation distance three distinct vortex patterns are identified in the strohual numberseparation distance phase maps which include separated wake merged wake and transitionalmerged wake furthermore a novel model is introduced based on fundamental flow variables including velocity location and circulation of dipole structures to quantitatively distinguish vortex patterns in the wake the physical mechanism of wake merging process is also elucidated when an oscillating foil experiences the jet deflection phenomenon secondary structures shed from the primary street traverse in the other direction by making an angle with its parent vortex street for parallel foils secondary structures from the vortex street of the lower foil interact with the primary vortex street of the upper foil under certain kinematic conditions this interaction triggers the wake merging process by influencing circulation of coherent structures in the upper part of the wake it is unveiled that merging of the wakes leads to enhancements in propulsive efficiency by increasing thrust generation without a significant alteration in power requirements these are attributed to the formation of a highmomentum jet by the merged vortex street which possesses significantly larger circulation due to the amalgamation of the vortices and major alterations in the evolution of leading edge vortices thus flow physics that are thoroughly explored here are crucial in providing novel insights for future development of flow control techniques for efficient designs of bioinspired underwater propulsors,physics

we revisit the gradient descent dynamics of the spherical sherringtonkirkpatrick p model with finite number of degrees of freedom for fully random initial conditions we confirm that the relaxation takes place in three time regimes a first algebraic one controlled by the decay of the eigenvalue distribution of the random exchange interaction matrix at its edge in the infinite size limit a faster algebraic one determined by the distribution of the gap between the two extreme eigenvalues and a final exponential one determined by the minimal gap sampled in the disorder average we also analyse the finite size effects on the relaxation from initial states which are almost projected on the saddles of the potential energy landscape and we show that for deviations scaling as nnu from perfect alignment the system escapes the initial configuration in a timescale scaling as ln n after which the dynamics no longer selfaverages with respect to the initial conditions we prove these statements with a combination of analytic and numerical methods,cond-mat
pure hadronic compact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass central pressure are metastable to the conversion to quark stars hybrid or strange stars in this paper we present a systematic study of the metastability of pure hadronic compact stars using different relativistic models for the equation of state eos in particular we compare results for the quarkmeson coupling qmc model with those for the glendenningmoszkowski parametrization of the nonlinear walecka model nlwm for qmc model we find large values m_cr m_odot for the critical mass of the hadronic star sequence and we find that the formation of a quark star is only possible with a soft quark matter eos for the glendenningmoszkowski parametrization of the nlwm we explore the effect of different hyperon couplings on the critical mass and on the stellar conversion energy we find that increasing the value of the hyperon coupling constants shifts the bulk transition point for quark deconfinement to higher densities increases the stellar metastability threshold mass and the value of the critical mass and thus makes the formation of quark stars less likely for the largest values of the hyperon couplings we find a critical mass which may be as high as m_odot these stellar configurations which contain a large central hyperon fraction f_ycr sim would be able to describe highlymassive compact stars such as the one associated to the millisecond pulsars psr bb with a mass m _ m_odot,astro-ph

we have monitored twelve t dwarfs with the kitt peak m telescope using an fw filter microns to place in context the remarkable variability exhibited by the nearby t dwarf luhman b in this wavelength regime the motivation was the poorly known red optical behavior of t dwarfs which have been monitored almost exclusively at infrared wavelengths where variability amplitudes greater than have been found to be very rare we detect highly significant variability in two t dwarfs the t dwarf mass shows consistent variability on two consecutive nights the t dwarf mass j exhibits variability that may evolve from night to night similarly to luhman b both objects were previously known to be variable in the infrared but with considerably lower amplitudes we also find evidence for variability in the t dwarf j but since it has lower significance we conservatively refrain from claiming this object as a variable we explore and rule out various telluric effects demonstrating that the variations we detect are astrophysically real we suggest that highamplitude photometric variability for t dwarfs is likely more common in the red optical than at longer wavelengths the two new members of the growing class of highamplitude variable t dwarfs offer excellent prospects for further study of cloud structures and their evolution,astro-ph

we report a detection of the coherent distortion of faint galaxies arising from gravitational lensing by foreground structures this cosmic shear is potentially the most direct measure of the mass power spectrum as it is unaffected by poorlyjustified assumptions made concerning the biasing of the distribution our detection is based on an initial imaging study of separated x fields observed in good homogeneous conditions with the prime focus eev ccd camera of the m william herschel telescope we detect an rms shear of in x cells with a significance of sigma we carefully justify this detection by quantifying various systematic effects and carrying out extensive simulations of the recovery of the shear signal from artificial images defined according to measured instrument characteristics we also verify our detection by computing the crosscorrelation between the shear in adjacent cells including gaussian cosmic variance we measure the shear variance to be plusminus plusminus where these sigma errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties respectively our measurements are consistent with the predictions of clusternormalised cdm models within sigma but a cobenormalised scdm model is ruled out at the sigma level for the currentlyfavoured lambdacdm model with omega_m our measurement provides a normalisation of the mass power spectrum of sigma_ plusminus fully consistent with that derived from cluster abundances our result demonstrates that groundbased telescopes can with adequate care be used to constrain the mass power spectrum on various scales the present results are limited mainly by cosmic variance which can be overcome in the near future with more observations,astro-ph
field emission data are often represented on a fowlernordheim plot but a new empirical equation has been recently proposed to better analyze experiments such an equation is based on approximations of the murphy and good model and predicts that a constant parameter kappa depending only on the work function of the emitter can be extracted from the data we compared this empirical equation with simulations of the murphy and good model in order to determine the range of validity of the approximations and the robustness of the relationship between kappa and the work function we found that kappa is constant only over a limited range of electric fields and so depends significantly on the field enhancement factor this result calls into question the usefulness of the new empirical equation,cond-mat
we perform a comprehensive survey of the potential energy landscapes of atom morse clusters and describe how they can be characterized and visualized our aim is to detail how the global features of the funnellike surface change with the range of the potential and to relate these changes to the dynamics of structural relaxation we find that the landscape becomes rougher and less steep as the range of the potential decreases and that relaxation paths to the global minimum become more complicated,cond-mat
we study the backward compatible problem for person reidentification reid which aims to constrain the features of an updated new model to be comparable with the existing features from the old model in galleries most of the existing works adopt distillationbased methods which focus on pushing new features to imitate the distribution of the old ones however the distillationbased methods are intrinsically suboptimal since it forces the new feature space to imitate the inferior old feature space to address this issue we propose the rankingbased backward compatible learning rbcl which directly optimizes the ranking metric between new features and old features different from previous methods rbcl only pushes the new features to find bestranking positions in the old feature space instead of strictly alignment and is in line with the ultimate goal of backward retrieval however the sharp sigmoid function used to make the ranking metric differentiable also incurs the gradient vanish issue therefore stems the ranking refinement during the later period of training to address this issue we propose the dynamic gradient reactivation dgr which can reactivate the suppressed gradients by adding dynamic computed constant during forward step to further help targeting the bestranking positions we include the neighbor context agents ncas to approximate the entire old feature space during training unlike previous works which only test on the indomain settings we make the first attempt to introduce the crossdomain settings including both supervised and unsupervised which are more meaningful and difficult the experimental results on all five settings show that the proposed rbcl outperforms previous stateoftheart methods by large margins under all settings,cs

the binary star par in the orion nebula presents an interesting puzzle in the field of stellar dynamics and evolution binary systems such as par are thought to form from the same natal material and thus the stellar members are expected to have very similar physical attributes however par s stars have significantly different temperatures despite their identical within masses of about solar mass the leading proofofconcept idea is that a third companion gravitationally induced the two stars to orbit closer than their rochelimit which facilitated heating through tidal effects here we expand on this idea and study the threebody dynamical evolution of such a system including tidal and premainsequence evolution we also include tidal heating and mass transfer at the onset of rochelimit crossing we show as a proofofconcept that mass transfer combined with tidal heating can naturally explain the observed temperature discrepancy we also predict the orbital configuration of the possible tertiary companion finally we suggest that the dynamical evolution of such a system has pervasive consequences we expect an abundance of systems to undergo mass transfer during their premainsequence time which can cause temperature differences,astro-ph

this paper proposes a privacypreserving and accountable billing pabill protocol for trading in peertopeer energy markets addressing situations where there may be discrepancies between the volume of energy committed and delivered such discrepancies can lead to challenges in providing both privacy and accountability while maintaining accurate billing to overcome these challenges a universal cost splitting mechanism is proposed that prioritises privacy and accountability it leverages a homomorphic encryption cryptosystem to provide privacy and employs blockchain technology to establish accountability a dispute resolution mechanism is also introduced to minimise the occurrence of erroneous bill calculations while ensuring accountability and nonrepudiation throughout the billing process our evaluation demonstrates that pabill offers an effective billing mechanism that maintains privacy and accountability in peertopeer energy markets utilising a semidecentralised approach,cs

motion planning is a fundamental problem and focuses on finding control inputs that enable a robot to reach a goal region while safely avoiding obstacles however in many situations the state of the system may not be known but only estimated using for instance a kalman filter this results in a novel motion planning problem where safety must be ensured in the presence of state estimation uncertainty previous approaches to this problem are either conservative or integrate state estimates optimistically which leads to nonrobust solutions optimistic solutions require frequent replanning to not endanger the safety of the system we propose a new formulation to this problem with the aim to be robust to state estimation errors while not being overly conservative in particular we formulate a stochastic optimal control problem that contains robustified riskaware safety constraints by incorporating robustness margins to account for state estimation errors we propose a novel samplingbased approach that builds trees exploring the reachable space of gaussian distributions that capture uncertainty both in state estimation and in future measurements we provide robustness guarantees and show both in theory and simulations that the induced robustness margins constitute a tradeoff between conservatism and robustness for planning under estimation uncertainty that allows to control the frequency of replanning,cs
the ability to manipulate electron spins with voltagedependent electric fields is key to the operation of quantum spintronics devices such as spinbased semiconductor qubits a natural approach to electrical spin control exploits the spinorbit coupling soc inherently present in all materials so far this approach could not be applied to electrons in silicon due to their extremely weak soc here we report an experimental realization of electrically driven electronspin resonance in a silicononinsulator soi nanowire quantum dot device the underlying driving mechanism results from an interplay between soc and the multivalley structure of the silicon conduction band which is enhanced in the investigated nanowire geometry we present a simple model capturing the essential physics and use tightbinding simulations for a more quantitative analysis we discuss the relevance of our findings to the development of compact and scalable electronspin qubits in silicon,cond-mat
recently it was claimed that the twophase localnonlocal constitutive models give wellposed nonlocal field problems and eliminates the illposedness of the fully nonlocal constitutive models in this study it is demonstrated that both the fully nonlocal and the twophase localnonlocal constitutive models secrete illposed nonlocal boundary value problems moreover it is revealed that all eringen integral and differential nonlocal constitutive models secrete unsolvable nonlocal boundary value problems in this study it is demonstrated that solutions of nonlocal elasticity problems are exist and eringen constitutive model cannot determine these solutions to overcome the limitations of eringen constitutive models novel integral and differential iterative nonlocal residual constitutive models are proposed using these two constitutive models the sum of the nonlocal residual field at a point is iteratively formed then this nonlocal residual is imposed to the local boundary value problem thus the nonlocal elasticity is obtained in the form of a local boundary value problem with an imposed nonlocal residual field using any of these constitutive models a solution is guaranteed for a nonlocal field problem to show the effectiveness of the proposed constitutive models the nonlocal field problems of beams with different natural boundary conditions are considered the results of the proposed integral and differential constitutive models are identical and feasible,physics

a perfect k_rtiling in a graph g is a collection of vertexdisjoint copies of k_r that together cover all the vertices in g in this paper we consider perfect k_rtilings in the setting of randomly perturbed graphs a model introduced by bohman frieze and martin where one starts with a dense graph and then adds m random edges to it specifically given any fixed alpha r we determine how many random edges one must add to an nvertex graph g of minimum degree delta g geq alpha n to ensure that asymptotically almost surely the resulting graph contains a perfect k_rtiling as one increases alpha we demonstrate that the number of random edges required jumps at regular intervals and within these intervals our result is bestpossible this work therefore closes the gap between the seminal work of johansson kahn and vu which resolves the purely random case ie alpha and that of hajnal and szemeredi which demonstrates that for alpha geq r the initial graph already houses the desired perfect k_rtiling,math

we present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas solar wind interstellar medium galaxy clusters accretion disks the key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency the energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat which ultimately cannot be done without collisions a kinetic cascade develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations in each of the physically distinct scale ranges the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations in the inertial range above the ion gyroscale the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of alfvenic fluctuations which are governed by the rmhd equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the alfvenic component in the dissipation range between the ion and electron gyroscales there are again two cascades the kineticalfvenwave kaw cascade governed by two fluidlike electron rmhd equations and a passive phasespace cascade of ion entropy fluctuations the latter cascade brings the energy of the inertialrange fluctuations that was damped by collisionless waveparticle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating the kaw energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat kolmogorovstyle scaling relations are derived for these cascades astrophysical and spacephysical applications are discussed in detail,astro-ph

the main objective for this research was the analytical exploration of the dynamics of planar satellite rotation during the motion of an elliptical orbit around a planet first we revisit the results of j wisdom et al in which by the elegant change of variables considering the true anomaly f as the independent variable the governing equation of satellite rotation takes the form of an abel ode of the second kind a sort of generalization of the riccati ode we note that due to the special character of solutions of a riccatitype ode there exists the possibility of sudden jumping in the magnitude of the solution at some moment of time in the physical sense this jumping of the riccatitype solutions of the governing ode could be associated with the effect of sudden accelerationdeceleration in the satellite rotation around the chosen principle axis at a definite moment of parametric time this means that there exists not only a chaotic satellite rotation regime as per the results of j wisdom et al but a kind of gradient catastrophe arnold could occur during the satellite rotation process we especially note that if a gradient catastrophe could occur this does not mean that it must occur such a possibility depends on the initial conditions in addition we obtained asymptotical solutions that manifest a quasiperiodic character even with the strong simplifying assumptions e p which reduce the governing equation of j wisdom et al to a kind of beletskii equation,physics

understanding the raman spectroscopy at the atomistic level is important for the elucidation of dynamical processes in liquid water because the polarizability or its time derivative is often a highly nonlinear function of coordinates orand momenta we employ the linearized semiclassical initial value representation for quantum dynamical simulations of liquid water and heavy water under ambient conditions based on an ab initio based flexible polarizable model the polivs force field it is shown that quantum dynamical effects play a critical role in reproducing the peaks in the intermediate region between the librational and bending bands those between the bending and stretching bands and the doublepeak in the stretching band in the experimental isotropic raman spectrum in contrast quantum dynamical effects are important but less decisive in the anisotropic raman spectrum by selectively freezing either the intramolecular oh stretching or hoh bending mode we demonstrate that the peak in the intermediate region cm of the isotropic raman spectrum arises from the interplay of the stretching and bending motions while a substantial part of the peak in the same intermediate region of the anisotropic raman spectrum may be attributed to the combined motion of the bending and librational modes,physics

the arrival directions of tevpev cosmic rays are remarkably uniform due to the isotropization of their directions by scattering on turbulent magnetic fields small anisotropies can exist in standard diffusion models however only on the largest angular scales yet highstatistics observatories like icecube and hawc have found significant deviations from isotropy down to small angular scales here we explain the formation of smallscale anisotropies by considering pairs of cosmic rays that get correlated by their transport through the same realisation of the turbulent magnetic field we argue that the formation of smallscale anisotropies is the reflection of the particular realisation of the turbulent magnetic field experienced by cosmic rays on time scales intermediate between the early ballistic regime and the late diffusive regime we approach this problem in two different ways first we run test particle simulations in synthetic turbulence covering for the first time the tv rigidities of observations with realistic turbulence parameters second we extend the recently introduced mixing matrix approach and determine the steadystate angular power spectrum throughout we adopt magnetostatic slablike turbulence we find excellent agreement between the predicted angular power spectra in both approaches over a large range of rigidities in the future measurements of smallscale anisotropies will be valuable in constraining the nature of the turbulent magnetic field in our galactic neighborhood,astro-ph
the variational graph autoencoder and its variants have been popularly used for representation learning on graphstructured data while the encoder is often a powerful graph convolutional network the decoder reconstructs the graph structure by only considering two nodes at a time thus ignoring possible interactions among edges on the other hand structured prediction which considers the whole graph simultaneously is computationally expensive in this paper we utilize the wellknown triadic closure property which is exhibited in many realworld networks we propose the triad decoder which considers and predicts the three edges involved in a local triad together the triad decoder can be readily used in any graphbased autoencoder in particular we incorporate this to the variational graph autoencoder experiments on link prediction node clustering and graph generation show that the use of triads leads to more accurate prediction clustering and better preservation of the graph characteristics,cs

flat bands are of extreme interest in a broad spectrum of fields since given by their high degeneracy a small perturbation introduced in the system is able to push the ground state in the direction of an ordered phase of interest hence the flat band engineering in real materials attracts huge attention however manufacturing a flat band represents a difficult task because its appearance in a real system is connected to rigid mathematical conditions relating a part of hamiltonian parameters consequently whenever a flat band is desired to be manufactured these hamiltonian parameters must be tuned exactly to the values fixed by these rigid mathematical conditions here we demonstrate that taking the manybody spinorbit interaction soi into account which can be continuously tuned eg by external electric fields these rigid mathematical conditions can be substantially relaxed on this line we show that a sim variation in the hamiltonian parameters rigidly fixed by the flat band conditions can also lead to flat bands in the same or in a bit displaced position on the energy axis this percentage can even increase to sim in the presence of an external magnetic field the study is made in the case of conducting polymers these systems are relevant not only because they have broad application possibilities but also because they can be used to present the mathematical background of the flat band conditions in full generality in a concise clear and understandable manner applicable everywhere in itinerant systems,cond-mat

selfregulating agn feedback in the cool cores of galaxy clusters plays central role in solving the decadesold cooling flow problem but one major problem remains unsolved how is the agn energy thermalized in the icm and what are the effective black hole feeding rates in realistic systems we perform a suite of d mhd amr simulations of agn feedback in a cool core cluster including cosmic ray cr physics crs are supplied to the icm via collimated agn jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized icm via streaming and interact with the icm via hadronic coulomb and streaming instability heating we find that cr transport is an essential model ingredient needed for agn feedback to selfregulate at least within the context of the physical model considered here when cr streaming is neglected the suppression of cr mixing with the icm by magnetic fields significantly reduces icm heating which leads to cooling catastrophes in the opposite case crs come into contact with the ambient icm and efficiently heat it which results in globally stable atmospheres moreover the dynamical state and intermittency of the central agn are dramatically altered when cr streaming is present we find that cr streaming heating dominates over the heating due to coulomb and hadronic processes importantly in simulations that include cr streaming cr pressure support in the central kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate observational constraints on the contrary when cr streaming is neglected cr energy is not spent on the icm heating and cr pressure builds up to the level that is in disagreement with the data overall our models demonstrate that cr heating is a viable channel for the thermalization of agn energy in clusters and likely also in elliptical galaxies and that crs play an important role in determining agn intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres,astro-ph

this paper employs correctbyconstruction control synthesis in particular controlled invariant set computations for falsification our hypothesis is that if it is possible to compute a large enough controlled invariant set either for the actual system model or some simplification of the system model interesting corner cases for other control designs can be generated by sampling initial conditions from the boundary of this controlled invariant set moreover if falsifying trajectories for a given control design can be found through such sampling then the controlled invariant set can be used as a supervisor to ensure safe operation of the control design under consideration in addition to interesting initial conditions which are mostly related to safety violations in transients we use solutions from a dual game a reachability game for the safety specification to find falsifying inputs we also propose optimizationbased heuristics for input generation for cases when the state is outside the winning set of the dual game to demonstrate the proposed ideas we consider case studies from basic autonomous driving functionality in particular adaptive cruise control and lane keeping we show how the proposed technique can be used to find interesting falsifying trajectories for classical control designs like proportional controllers proportional integral controllers and model predictive controllers as well as an open source realworld autonomous driving package,cs
the transport of waves and turbulence beyond the photosphere is central to the coronal heating problem turbulence in the quiet solar corona has been modeled on the basis of the nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamic ni mhd theory to describe the transport of lowfrequency turbulence in open magnetic field regions it describes the evolution of the coupled majority quasid and minority slab component driven by the magnetic carpet and advected by a subsonic subalfvenic flow from the lower corona in this paper we couple the ni mhd turbulence transport model with an mhd model of the solar corona to study the heating problem in a coronal loop in a realistic benchmark coronal loop problem we find that a loop can be heated to million k by transport and dissipation of mhd turbulence described by the ni mhd model we also find that the majority d component is as important as the minority slab component in the heating of the coronal loop we compare our coupled mhdni mhd model results with a reduced mhd rmhd model an important distinction between these models is that rmhd solves for smallscale velocity and magnetic field fluctuations and obtains the actual viscousresistive dissipation associated with their evolution whereas ni mhd evolves scalar moments of the fluctuating velocity and magnetic fields and approximates dissipation using an mhd turbulence phenomenology despite the basic differences between the models their simulation results match remarkably well yielding almost identical heating rates inside the corona,astro-ph

filtering has had a profound impact as a device of perceiving information and deriving agent expectations in dynamic economic models for an abstract economic system this paper shows that the foundation of applying the filtering method corresponds to the existence of a conditional expectation as an equilibrium process agentbased rational behavior of looking backward and looking forward is generalized to a conditional expectation process where the economic system is approximated by a class of models which can be represented and estimated without information loss the proposed framework elucidates the range of applications of a general filtering device and is not limited to a particular model class such as rational expectations,math

outofdistribution detection is crucial to the safe deployment of machine learning systems currently unsupervised outofdistribution detection is dominated by generativebased approaches that make use of estimates of the likelihood or other measurements from a generative model reconstructionbased methods offer an alternative approach in which a measure of reconstruction error is used to determine if a sample is outofdistribution however reconstructionbased approaches are less favoured as they require careful tuning of the models information bottleneck such as the size of the latent dimension to produce good results in this work we exploit the view of denoising diffusion probabilistic models ddpm as denoising autoencoders where the bottleneck is controlled externally by means of the amount of noise applied we propose to use ddpms to reconstruct an input that has been noised to a range of noise levels and use the resulting multidimensional reconstruction error to classify outofdistribution inputs we validate our approach both on standard computervision datasets and on higher dimension medical datasets our approach outperforms not only reconstructionbased methods but also stateoftheart generativebased approaches code is available at httpsgithubcommarksgrahamddpmood,cs

broad emission lines are the most characteristic features in the spectra of active galaxies they mostly show either a singlepeaked or doublepeaked profiles and originate from a complex dynamics of the likely discrete clouds moving in a spatially extended region socalled broad line region blr we follow a nonhydrodynamical singlecloud approach to the blr dynamics based on the dustdriving model of czerny hryniewicz we previously showed in details that the d version of the model could provide us with the d geometry of the blr in this paper we provide a large grid of results based on which we aim at testing the model with calculation of the spectral line generic profiles we show that the shape of profiles not only depends on the accretion rate of the source the black hole mass and the viewing angle but also it is most significantly affected by the adopted dusttogas mass ratio that regulates the strength of the radiation pressure we also show that the model can appropriately explain the low ionized broad emission lines of the mean spectrum of quasars such as mgii and hbeta,astro-ph

the simulation of light scattering by particles on a substrate with the tmatrix method relies on the expansion of the scattered field in spherical waves followed by a plane wave expansion to allow the evaluation of the reflection from the substrate in practice the plane wave expansion ie the sommerfeld integrals needs to be truncated at a maximal inplane wavenumber kappa_mathrmmax an appropriate selection of kappa_mathrmmax is essential counterintuitively the overall accuracy can degrade significantly if the integrals are truncated with a too large value in this paper we propose an empirical formula for the selection of kappa_mathrmmax and discuss its application using a number of example simulations with dielectric and metallic oblate spheroids on dielectric and metallic substrates the computed differential scattering cross sections are compared to results obtained from the discretesources method,physics

proper optimization of deep neural networks is an open research question since an optimal procedure to change the learning rate throughout training is still unknown manually defining a learning rate schedule involves troublesome timeconsuming try and error procedures to determine hyperparameters such as learning rate decay epochs and learning rate decay rates although adaptive learning rate optimizers automatize this process recent studies suggest they may produce overffiting and reduce performance when compared to finetuned learning rate schedules considering that deep neural networks loss functions present landscapes with much more saddle points than local minima we proposed the training aware sigmoidal optimizer taso which consists of a twophases automated learning rate schedule the first phase uses a high learning rate to fast traverse the numerous saddle point while the second phase uses low learning rate to slowly approach the center of the local minimum previously found we compared the proposed approach with commonly used adaptive learning rate schedules such as adam rmsprop and adagrad our experiments showed that taso outperformed all competing methods in both optimal ie performing hyperparameter validation and suboptimal ie using default hyperparameters scenarios,cs

by an undirected rigid formation of mobile autonomous agents is meant a formation based on graph rigidity in which each pair of neighboring agents is responsible for maintaining a prescribed target distance between them in a recent paper a systematic method was proposed for devising gradient control laws for asymptotically stabilizing a large class of rigid undirected formations in two dimensional space assuming all agents are described by kinematic point models the aim of this paper is to explain what happens to such formations if neighboring agents have slightly different understandings of what the desired distance between them is supposed to be or equivalently if neighboring agents have differing estimates of what the actual distance between them is in either case what one would expect would be a gradual distortion of the formation from its target shape as discrepancies in desired or sensed distances increase while this is observed for the gradient laws in question something else quite unexpected happens at the same time it is shown that for any rigiditybased undirected formation of this type which is comprised of three or more agents that if some neighboring agents have slightly different understandings of what the desired distances between them are suppose to be then almost for certain the trajectory of the resulting distorted but rigid formation will converge exponentially fast to a closed circular orbit in twodimensional space which is traversed periodically at a constant angular speed,cs

the current article examines the approximate controllability problem for noninstantaneous impulsive fractional evolution equations of order alpha with statedependent delay in separable reflexive banach spaces in order to establish sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of our problem we first formulate the linearregulator problem and obtain the optimal control in feedback form by using this optimal control we deduce the approximate controllability of the linear fractional control system of order alpha further we derive sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of the nonlinear problem finally we provide a concrete example to validate the efficiency of the derived results,math

we measure the angular autocorrelation functions w of sdss galaxies selected to have photometric redshifts z and absolute rband magnitudes mr we split these galaxies into five overlapping redshift shells of width and measure w in each subsample in order to investigate the evolution of sdss galaxies we find that the bias increases substantially with redshift much more so than one would expect for a passively evolving sample we use halomodel analysis to determine the bestfit halooccupationdistribution hod for each subsample and the bestfit models allow us to interpret the change in bias physically in order to properly interpret our bestfit hods we convert each halo mass to its z passively evolved bias bo enabling a direct comparison of the bestfit hods at different redshifts we find that the minimum halo bo required to host a galaxy decreases as the redshift decreases suggesting that galaxies with mr are forming in halos at the lowmass end of the hods over our redshift range we use the bestfit hods to determine the change in occupation number divided by the change in mass of halos with constant bo and we find a sharp peak at bo corresponding to an average halo mass of msolh we thus present the following scenario the bias of galaxies with mr decreases as the universe evolves because these galaxies form in halos of mass msolh independent of redshift and the bias of these halos naturally decreases as the universe evolves,astro-ph

tikhonov regularization is a common technique used when solving poorly behaved optimization problems often and with good reason this technique is applied by practitioners in an ad hoc fashion in this note we systematically illustrate the role of tikhonov regularizations in two simple yet instructive examples in one example we use regular perturbation theory to predict the impact tikhonov regularizations have on condition numbers of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices we then use a numerical example to confirm our result in another example we construct an exactly solvable optimal control problem that exhibits a boundary layer phenomenon since optimal control problems are rarely exactly solvable this brings clarity to how vital tikhonov regularizations are for the class of problems this example represents we solve the problem numerically using matlabs builtin optimization software and compare results with a galerkintypegenetic algorithm we find the second method generally outperforms matlabs optimization routines and we provide the matlab code used to generate the numerics finally to demonstrate the utility of tikhonov regularization from the second example in a more technologically realistic application we show that regularization guides the design of gradientindex optical devices toward those which are significantly less expensive to fabricate,math
because of their periodluminosity relation plr classical cepheids play a key role in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the hubblelemaitre constant h_ recent findings show that the majority of classical cepheids should be in binary or multiple systems which might undermine their accuracy as the extra and unaccounted for light from the companions of cepheids causes a shift in the plr we quantify this shift using synthetic populations of binary cepheids that we developed for this purpose as described in paper i of this series we find that while all plrs are shifted toward brighter values due to the excess light from the companions the bias in the relative distance modulus between two galaxies hosting binary cepheids can be either positive or negative depending on the percentage of binary cepheids in them if the binarity percentage in the two galaxies is similar the effect of binarity is canceled otherwise it introduces a shift in the distance modulus of the order of millimags in the nearinfrared passbands and wesenheit indices and tens of millimags in the visual domain its exact value depends on the variant of the synthetic population a unique combination of metallicity star formation history shape and location of the instability strip and initial parameter distributions such shifts in distance moduli to type ia supernova host galaxies introduce an additional statistical error on h_ which however does not prevent measuring h_ with a precision of,astro-ph

the concept of time series irreversibility the degree by which the statistics of signals are not invariant under time reversal naturally appears in nonequilibrium physics in stationary systems which operate away from equilibrium and produce entropy this concept has not been explored to date in the realm of musical scores as these are typically short sequences whose time reversibility estimation could suffer from strong finite size effects which preclude interpretability here we show that the socalled horizontal visibility graph method which recently was shown to quantify such statistical property even in nonstationary signals is a method that can estimate time reversibility of short symbolic sequences thus unlocking the possibility of exploring such properties in the context of musical compositions accordingly we analyse over musical pieces ranging from the renaissance to the early modern period and certify that indeed most of them display clear signatures of time irreversibility since by construction stochastic processes with a linear correlation structure such as f noise are time reversible we conclude that musical compositions have a considerably richer structure that goes beyond the traditional properties retrieved by the power spectrum or similar approaches we also show that musical compositions display strong signs of nonlinear correlations that nonlinearity is correlated to irreversibility and that these are also related to asymmetries in the abundance of musical intervals which we associate to the narrative underpinning a musical composition these findings provide tools for the study of musical periods and composers as well as criteria related to music appreciation and cognition,physics

deuterium plays a crucial role in cosmology because the primordial dh abundance in the context of big bang nucleosynthesis bbn theory yields a precise measure of the cosmic baryon content observations of dh can limit or measure the true primordial abundance because d is thought to be destroyed by stars and thus dh monotonically decreases after bbn recently however mullan linsky have pointed out that d arises as a secondary product of neutrons in stellar flares which then capture on protons via np to d gamma and that this could dominate over direct d production in flares mullan linsky note that if this process is sufficiently vigorous in flaring dwarf stars it could lead to significant nonbbn d production we have considered the production of d in stellar flares both directly and by n capture we find that for reasonable flare spectra nd and ndli both of which indicate that the ncapture channel does not allow for galactic d production at a level which will reverse the monotonic decline of d we also calculate the mev gammaray line production associated with n capture and find that existing comptel limits also rule out significant d production in the galaxy today thus we find flares in particular and neutron captures in general are not an important galactic source of d on the other hand we cannot exclude that flare production might contribute to recent fuse observations of large variations in the local interstellar dh abundance we do however offer important constraints on this possibility finally since flare stars should inevitably produce some ncapture events a search for diffuse mev gammarays by integral can further constrain or measure galactic deuterium production via ncapture,astro-ph

what are the structural determinants of protein sequence evolution a number of sitespecific structural characteristics have been proposed most of which are broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent accessibility of individual residues most importantly there has been disagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent accessibility and local packing density for explaining sitespecific sequence variability in proteins we show here that this discussion has been confounded by the definition of local packing density the most commonly used measures of local packing such as the contact number and the weighted contact number represent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and longerrange effects as an alternative we here propose a truly local measure of packing density around a single residue based on the voronoi cell volume we show that the voronoi cell volume when calculated relative to the geometric center of aminoacid side chains behaves nearly identically to the relative solvent accessibility and both can explain on average approximately of the sitespecific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of enzymes an additional of variation can be explained by nonlocal effects that are captured in the weighted contact number consequently evolutionary variation at a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate aminoacid neighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids we conclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing density future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate contacts and longerrange effects on evolutionary variation,physics

all of the proposed explanations for the microlensing events observed towards the lmc have difficulties one of these proposed explanations lmc selflensing which invokes ordinary lmc stars as the long soughtafter lenses has recently gained considerable popularity as a possible solution to the microlensing conundrum in this paper we carefully examine the set of lmc selflensing models in particular we review the pertinent observations made of the lmc and show how these observations place limits on such selflensing models we find that given current observational constraints no purely lmc disk models are capable of producing optical depths as large as that reported in the macho collaboration year analysis besides pure disk we also consider alternate geometries and present a framework which encompasses the previous studies of lmc selflensing we discuss which model parameters need to be pushed in order for such models to succeed for example like previous workers we find that an lmc halo geometry may be able to explain the observed events however since all known lmc tracer stellar populations exhibit disklike kinematics such models will have difficulty being reconciled with observations for smc selflensing we find predicted optical depths differing from previous results but more than sufficient to explain all observed smc microlensing in contrast for the lmc we find a selflensing optical depth contribution between e and e with e being the value for the set of lmc parameters most consistent with current observations,astro-ph

a typical conversation comprises of multiple turns between participants where they go backandforth between different topics at each user turn dialogue state tracking dst aims to estimate users goal by processing the current utterance however in many turns users implicitly refer to the previous goal necessitating the use of relevant dialogue history nonetheless distinguishing relevant history is challenging and a popular method of using dialogue recency for that is inefficient we therefore propose a novel framework for dst that identifies relevant historical context by referring to the past utterances where a particular slotvalue changes and uses that together with weighted system utterance to identify the relevant context specifically we use the current user utterance and the most recent system utterance to determine the relevance of a system utterance empirical analyses show that our method improves joint goal accuracy by and on woz and multiwoz restaurant domain datasets respectively over the previous stateoftheart glad model,cs

in this paper a novel framework is proposed for optimizing the operation and performance of a largescale multihop millimeter wave mmw backhaul within a wireless small cell network scn that encompasses multiple mobile network operators mnos the proposed framework enables the small base stations sbss to jointly decide on forming the multihop mmw links over backhaul infrastructure that belongs to multiple independent mnos while properly allocating resources across those links in this regard the problem is addressed using a novel framework based on matching theory that is composed to two highly interrelated stages a multihop network formation stage and a resource management stage one unique feature of this framework is that it jointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors during both network formation and resource management the multihop network formation stage is formulated as a onetomany matching game which is solved using a novel algorithm that builds on the socalled deferred acceptance algorithm and is shown to yield a stable and pareto optimal multihop mmw backhaul network then a onetomany matching game is formulated to enable proper resource allocation across the formed multihop network this game is then shown to exhibit peer effects and as such a novel algorithm is developed to find a stable and optimal resource management solution that can properly cope with these peer effects simulation results show that the proposed framework yields substantial gains in terms of the average sum rate reaching up to and respectively compared to a noncooperative scheme in which interoperator sharing is not allowed and a random allocation approach the results also show that our framework provides insights on how to manage pricing and the cost of the cooperative mmw backhaul network for the mnos,cs

prompttuning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pretrained models to downstream tasks or aligning with human preferences prompt learning is widely used in nlp but has limited applicability to rl due to the complex physical meaning and environmentspecific information contained within rl prompts these factors require supervised learning to imitate the demonstrations and may result in a loss of meaning after learning additionally directly extending prompttuning approaches to rl is challenging because rl prompts guide agent behavior based on environmental modeling and analysis rather than filling in missing information making it unlikely that adjustments to the prompt format for downstream tasks as in nlp can yield significant improvements in this work we propose the prompttuning dt algorithm to address these challenges by using trajectory segments as prompts to guide rl agents in acquiring environmental information and optimizing prompts via blackbox tuning to enhance their ability to contain more relevant information thereby enabling agents to make better decisions our approach involves randomly sampling a gaussian distribution to finetune the elements of the prompt trajectory and using preference ranking function to find the optimization direction thereby providing more informative prompts and guiding the agent towards specific preferences in the target environment extensive experiments show that with only of the parameters learned prompttuning dt achieves comparable or even better performance than fullmodel finetuning in lowdata scenarios our work contributes to the advancement of prompttuning approaches in rl providing a promising direction for optimizing large rl agents for specific preference tasks,cs

keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent years because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured query language nor to know the complex underlying database schemas most of existing methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static databases in practice however databases are updated frequently and users may have longterm interests on specific topics to deal with such a situation it is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in a database system to support continual keyword queries in this paper we propose an efficient method for answering continual topk keyword queries over relational databases the proposed method is built on an existing scheme of keyword search on relational data streams but incorporates the ranking mechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two improvements to support efficient topk keyword search in relational databases compared to the existing methods our method is more efficient both in computing the topk results in a static database and in maintaining the topk results when the database continually being updated experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method,cs
many hierarchically modular systems are structured in a way that resembles an hourglass this hourglass effect means that the system generates many outputs from many inputs through a relatively small number of intermediate modules that are critical for the operation of the entire system referred to as the waist of the hourglass we investigate the hourglass effect in general not necessarily layered hierarchical dependency networks our analysis focuses on the number of sourcetotarget dependency paths that traverse each vertex and it identifies the core of a dependency network as the smallest set of vertices that collectively cover almost all dependency paths we then examine if a given network exhibits the hourglass property or not comparing its core size with a flat ie nonhierarchical network that preserves the source dependencies of each target in the original network as a possible explanation for the hourglass effect we propose the reuse preference rp model that captures the bias of new modules to reuse intermediate modules of similar complexity instead of connecting directly to sources or low complexity modules we have applied the proposed framework in a diverse set of dependency networks from technological natural and information systems showing that all these networks exhibit the general hourglass property but to a varying degree and with different waist characteristics,cs

while allostery is of paramount importance for protein regulation the underlying dynamical process of ligand unbinding at one site resulting time evolution of the protein structure and change of the binding affinity at a remote site is not well understood here the ligandinduced conformational transition in a widely studied model system of allostery the pdz domain is investigated by transient infrared spectroscopy accompanied by molecular dynamics simulations to this end an azobenzene derived photoswitch is linked to a peptide ligand in a way that its binding affinity to the pdz domain changes upon switching thus initiating an allosteric transition in the pdz domain protein the subsequent response of the protein covering four decades of time ranging from simns to simmus can be rationalize by a remodelling of its rugged free energy landscape with ver subtle shifts in the populations of a small number of structurally well defined states it is proposed that structurally and dynamically driven allostery often discussed as limiting scenarios of allosteric communication actually go handinhand allowing the protein to adapt its free energy landscape to incoming signals,physics

when a rubber tube with free ends is inflated under volume control the pressure will first reach a maximum and then decrease monotonically to approach a constant asymptote the pressure maximum corresponds to the initiation of a localised bulge and is predicted by a bifurcation condition whereas the asymptote is the maxwell pressure corresponding to a twophase propagation state in contrast when the tube is first prestretched and then has its ends fixed during subsequent inflation the pressure versus bulge amplitude has both a maximum and a minimum and the behaviour on the right ascending branch has previously not been fully understood we show that for all values of prestretch and tube length the ascending branches all converge to a single curve that is only dependent on the ratio of tube thickness to the outer radius this curve represents the maxwell state to be approached in each case if euler buckling or axisymmetric wrinkling does not occur first but this state is pressuredependent in contrast with the freeends case we also demonstrate experimentally that localized bulging cannot occur when the prestretch is sufficiently large and investigate what strainenergy functions can predict this observed phenomenon,cond-mat

an important capability of autonomous multirobot systems is to prevent collision among the individual robots one approach to this problem is to plan conflictfree trajectories and let each of the robots follow its preplanned trajectory a widely used practical method for multirobot trajectory planning is prioritized planning which has been shown to be effective in practice but is in general incomplete formal analysis of instances that are provably solvable by prioritized planning is still missing moreover prioritized planning is a centralized algorithm which may be in many situations undesirable in this paper we a propose a revised version of prioritized planning and characterize the class of instances that are provably solvable by the algorithm and b propose an asynchronous decentralized variant of prioritized planning which maintains the desirable properties of the centralized version and in the same time exploits the distributed computational power of the individual robots which in most situations allows to find the joint trajectories faster the experimental evaluation performed on realworld indoor maps shows that a the revised version of prioritized planning reliably solves a wide class of instances on which both classical prioritized planning and popular reactive technique orca fail and b the asynchronous decentralized algorithm provides solution faster than the previously proposed synchronized decentralized algorithm,cs

several methods have been proposed to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset the basic ideal behind all of them has been to study an index that measures intercluster separation and intracluster cohesion over a range of cluster numbers and report the number which gives an optimum value of the index in this paper we propose a simple parameter free approach that is like human cognition to form clusters where closely lying points are easily identified to form a cluster and total number of clusters are revealed to identify closely lying points affinity of two points is defined as a function of distance and a threshold affinity is identified above which two points in a dataset are likely to be in the same cluster well separated clusters are identified even in the presence of outliers whereas for not so well separated dataset final number of clusters are estimated and the detected clusters are merged to produce the final clusters experiments performed with several large dimensional synthetic and real datasets show good results with robustness to noise and density variation within dataset,cs
firstprinciples based lattice models allow the modeling of ab initio thermodynamics of crystalline mixtures for applications such as the construction of phase diagrams and the identification of ground state atomic orderings the recent development of compressive sensing approaches for the construction of lattice models has further enabled the systematic construction of sparse physical models without the need for human intuition other than requiring the compactness of effective cluster interactions however conventional compressive sensing based on lnorm regularization is strictly only applicable to certain classes of optimization problems and is otherwise not guaranteed to generate optimally sparse and transferable results so that the method can only be applied to some materials science applications in this paper we illustrate a more robust llnorm compressivesensing method that removes the limitations of conventional compressive sensing and generally results in sparser lattice models that are at least as predictive as those obtained from lnorm compressive sensing apart from the theory a practical implementation based on stateoftheart mixedinteger quadratic programming miqp is proposed the robustness of our methodology is illustrated for four different transitionmetal oxides with relevance as battery cathode materials lixtixo lixniyo mgxcro and naxcro this method provides a practical and robust approach for the construction of sparser and more predictive lattice models improving on the compressive sensing paradigm and making it applicable to a much broader range of applications,physics

highthroughput plasma separation based on atomic mass holds the promise for offering unique solutions to a variety of highimpact societal applications through the mass differential effects they exhibit crossedfield configurations can in principle be exploited in various ways to separate ions based on atomic mass yet the practicality of these concepts is conditioned upon the ability to drive suitable crossedfield flows for plasma parameters compatible with highthroughput operation limited current predictive capabilities have not yet made it possible to confirm this possibility yet past experimental results suggest that endelectrodes biasing may be effective at least for certain electric field values a better understanding of crossfield conductivity is needed to confirm these results and confirm the potential of crossedfield configurations for highthroughput separation,physics

the system of two interacting bosons in a twodimensional harmonic trap is compared with the system consisting of two noninteracting fermions in the same potential in particular we discuss how the properties of the ground state of the system eg the different contributions to the total energy change as we vary both the strength and range of the atomatom interaction in particular we focus on the shortrange and strong interacting limit of the twoboson system and compare it to the noninteracting twofermion system by properly symmetrizing the corresponding degenerate ground state wave functions in that limit we show that the density profile of the twoboson system has a tendency similar to the system of two noninteracting fermions similarly the correlations induced when the interaction strength is increased result in a similar pair correlation function for both systems,cond-mat
electron transport through a nanostructure can be characterized in part using concepts from classical fluid dynamics it is thus natural to ask how far the analogy can be taken and whether the electron liquid can exhibit nonlinear dynamical effects such as turbulence here we present an abinitio study of the electron dynamics in nanojunctions which reveals that the latter indeed exhibits behavior quite similar to that of a classical fluid in particular we find that a transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs with increasing current corresponding to increasing reynolds numbers these results reveal unexpected features of electron dynamics and shed new light on our understanding of transport properties of nanoscale systems,cond-mat
micromagnetic simulation results on dynamic hysteresis loops of clusters of iron oxide nanoparticles nps with internal structure composed of nanorods are compared with the widely used macrospin approximation such calculations allowing for nanorodcomposed nps is facilitated by a previously developed coarsegraining method based on the renormalization group approach with a focus on applications to magnetic hyperthermia we show that magnetostatic interactions improve the heating performance of nps in chains and triangles and reduce heating performance in fcc arrangements hysteresis loops of triangular and fcc systems of complex nps are not recovered within the macrospin approximation especially at smaller interparticle distances for triangular arrangements the macrospin approximation predicts that magnetostatic interactions reduce loop area in contrast to the complex np case an investigation of the local hysteresis loops of individual nps and macrospins in clusters reveals the impact of the geometry of their neighbours on individual versus collective magnetic response inhomogenous heating within clusters and further differences between simulating nps with internal structure and the use of the macrospin approximation capturing the internal physical and magnetic structure of nps is thus important for some applications,cond-mat

we define a set of operations called crystal operations on matrices with entries either in or in n there are horizontal and vertical crystal operations giving rise to two commuting structures of a crystal graph on these matrices they provide a new perspective on many aspects of the rsk correspondence and its dual and related constructions under a straightforward encoding of semistandard tableaux by matrices the operations correspond to crystal operations on tableaux respectively to individual moves occurring during a jeu de taquin slide we show that the dual rsk correspondence and the burge correspondence arise as decompositions a matrix m can be transformed by crystal operations into each of the matrices encoding p and q symbol associated to m under these correspondences and it can be reconstructed from p and q these decomposition can also be interpreted as computing robinsons correspondence or as the robinsonschensted correspondence for pictures from a particular way of applying crystal operations the computation of these decompositions by growth diagrams can be deduced as well as the local rules that are to be used we show that that crystal operations leave a version of greenes poset invariant defined for matrices unchanged so that for such questions in the setting of matrices they can take the place of elementary knuth transformations on words,math

the verification of systems combining hard timing constraints with concurrency is challenging this challenge becomes even harder when some timing constants are missing or unknown parametric timed formalisms such as parametric timed automata ptas tackle the synthesis of such timing constants seen as parameters for which a property holds such formalisms are highly expressive but also undecidable and few decidable subclasses were proposed we propose here a syntactic restriction on ptas consisting in removing guards constraints on transitions to keep only invariants constraints on locations while this restriction preserves the expressiveness of ptas and therefore their undecidability an additional restriction on the type of constraints allows to not only prove decidability but also to perform the exact synthesis of parameter valuations satisfying reachability this formalism that seems trivial at first sight as it benefits from the decidability of the reachability problem with a better complexity than timed automata tas suffers from the undecidability of the whole tctl logic that tas on the contrary enjoy we believe our formalism allows for an interesting tradeoff between decidability and practical expressiveness and is therefore promising we show its applicability in a small case study,cs

to improve policy robustness of deep reinforcement learning agents a line of recent works focus on producing disturbances of the environment existing approaches of the literature to generate meaningful disturbances of the environment are adversarial reinforcement learning methods these methods set the problem as a twoplayer game between the protagonist agent which learns to perform a task in an environment and the adversary agent which learns to disturb the protagonist via modifications of the considered environment both protagonist and adversary are trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms alternatively we propose in this paper to build on gradientbased adversarial attacks usually used for classification tasks for instance that we apply on the critic network of the protagonist to identify efficient disturbances of the environment rather than learning an attacker policy which usually reveals as very complex and unstable we leverage the knowledge of the critic network of the protagonist to dynamically complexify the task at each step of the learning process we show that our method while being faster and lighter leads to significantly better improvements in policy robustness than existing methods of the literature,cs
mutually uncorrelated random discrete events manifesting a common basic process are examined often in terms of their occurrence rate as a function of one or more of their distinguishing attributes such as measurements of photon spectrum as a function of energy such rate distributions obtained from the observed attribute values for an ensemble of events will correspond to the true distribution only if the event occurrence were it mutually exclusive however due to finite resolution in such measurements the problem of event it pileup is not only unavoidable but also increases with event rate although extensive simulations to estimate the distortion due to pileup in the observed rate distribution are available no restoration procedure has yet been suggested here we present an elegant analytical solution to recover the underlying it true distribution our method based on poisson statistics and fourier transforms is shown to perform as desired even when applied to distributions that are significantly distorted by pileup our recipes for correction as well as for prediction of pileup are expected to find ready applications in a wide variety of fields ranging from highenergy physics to medical clinical diagnostics and involving but not limited to measurements of countrates andor spectra of incident radiation using charge coupled devices ccds or other similar devices,astro-ph

multitask gaussian processes mtgp are the gaussian process gp frameworks solution for multioutput regression problems in which the t elements of the regressors cannot be considered conditionally independent given the observations standard mtgp models assume that there exist both a multitask covariance matrix as a function of an intertask matrix and a noise covariance matrix these matrices need to be approximated by a low rank simplification of order p in order to reduce the number of parameters to be learnt from t to tp here we introduce a novel approach that simplifies the multitask learning by reducing it to a set of conditioned univariate gps without the need for any low rank approximations therefore completely eliminating the requirement to select an adequate value for hyperparameter p at the same time by extending this approach with both a hierarchical and an approximate model the proposed extensions are capable of recovering the multitask covariance and noise matrices after learning only t parameters avoiding the validation of any model hyperparameter and reducing the overall complexity of the model as well as the risk of overfitting experimental results over synthetic and real problems confirm the advantages of this inference approach in its ability to accurately recover the original noise and signal matrices as well as the achieved performance improvement in comparison to other state of art mtgp approaches we have also integrated the model with standard gp toolboxes showing that it is computationally competitive with state of the art options,cs

the aim of this paper is to clarify the conceptual difference which exists between the interactions of composite bosons and the interactions of elementary bosons a special focus is made on the physical processes which are missed when composite bosons are replaced by elementary bosons although what is here said directly applies to excitons it is also valid for bosons in other fields than semiconductor physics we in particular explain how the two basic scatterings coulomb and pauli of our manybody theory for composite excitons can be extended to a pair of fermions which is not an hamiltonian eigenstate as for example a pair of trapped electrons of current interest in quantum information,cond-mat

we consider a countable system of interacting possibly nonmarkovian stochastic differential equations driven by independent brownian motions and indexed by the vertices of a locally finite graph g ve the drift of the process at each vertex is influenced by the states of that vertex and its neighbors and the diffusion coefficient depends on the state of only that vertex such processes arise in a variety of applications including statistical physics neuroscience engineering and math finance under general conditions on the coefficients we show that if the initial conditions form a secondorder markov random field on ddimensional euclidean space then at any positive time the collection of histories of the processes at different vertices forms a secondorder markov random field on path space we also establish a bijection between secondorder gibbs measures on rdv with finite second moments and a set of spacetime secondorder gibbs measures on path space corresponding respectively to the initial law and the law of the solution to the stochastic differential equation as a corollary we establish a gibbs uniqueness property that shows that for infinite graphs the joint distribution of the paths is completely determined by the initial condition and the specifications namely the family of conditional distributions on finite vertex sets given the configuration on the complement along the way we establish various approximation and projection results for markov random fields on locally finite graphs that may be of independent interest,math

we compute the production of cosmic rays in the dynamical superbubble produced by a cluster of massive stars stellar winds supernova remnants and turbulence are found to accelerate particles so efficiently that the nonlinear feedback of the particles must be taken into account in order to ensure that the energy balance is not violated high energy particles do not scatter efficiently on the turbulence and escape quickly after each supernova explosion which makes both their intensity inside the bubble and injection in the interstellar medium intermittent on the other hand the stochastic acceleration of low energy particles hardens the spectra at gev energies because cosmic rays damp the turbulence cascade this hardening is less pronounced when nonlinearities are taken into account nevertheless spectra with hard components extending up to to gev and normalised to an energy density of to ev cm are found to be typical signatures of cosmic rays produced in superbubbles efficient shock reacceleration within compact clusters is further shown to produce hard slightly concave spectra while the presence of a magnetised shell is shown to enhance the confinement of cosmic rays in the bubble and therefore the collective plasma effects acting on them we eventually estimate the overall contribution of superbubbles to the galactic cosmic ray content and show typical gammaray spectra expected from hadronic interactions in superbuble shells in both cases a qualitative agreement with observations is obtained,astro-ph

policy optimization methods are popular reinforcement learning algorithms in practice recent works have built theoretical foundation for them by proving sqrtt regret bounds even when the losses are adversarial such bounds are tight in the worst case but often overly pessimistic in this work we show that in tabular markov decision processes mdps by properly designing the regularizer the exploration bonus and the learning rates one can achieve a more favorable polylogt regret when the losses are stochastic without sacrificing the worstcase guarantee in the adversarial regime to our knowledge this is also the first time a gapdependent polylogt regret bound is shown for policy optimization specifically we achieve this by leveraging a tsallis entropy or a shannon entropy regularizer in the policy update then we show that under known transitions we can further obtain a firstorder regret bound in the adversarial regime by leveraging the logbarrier regularizer,cs
experimental data suggests that at temperatures below k the pressure in liquid helium has a cubic dependence on density thus the speed of sound scales as a cubic root of pressure near a critical pressure point this speed approaches zero whereby the critical pressure is negative thus indicating a cavitation instability regime we demonstrate that to explain this dependence one has to view liquid helium as a mixture of three quantum bose liquids dilute grosspitaevskiitype boseeinstein condensate ginzburgsobyanintype fluid and logarithmic superfluid therefore the dynamics of such a mixture is described by a quantum wave equation which contains not only the polynomial grosspitaevskii and ginzburgsobyanin nonlinearities with respect to a condensate wavefunction but also a nonpolynomial logarithmic nonlinearity we derive an equation of state and speed of sound in our model and show their agreement with experiment,cond-mat

we introduce an effective dimer tightbinding model for the family of shastrysutherland models with geometrically tunable triplon excitations the rashba pseudospinorbit coupling induced by the tilted external magnetic field leads to elementary excitations having nontrivial topological properties with piberry flux the interplay between the inplane and outofplane magnetic field thus allows us to effectively engineer the band structure in this bosonic system in particular the inplane magnetic field gives rise to berry curvature hotspot near the bottom of the triplon band and at the same time significantly increases the critical magnetic field for the topological triplon band we calculate explicitly the experimental signature of the thermal hall effect of triplons in srcubo and show a pronounced and tunabled transport signals within the accessible parameter range particularly with a change of sign of the thermal hall conductance the tilted magnetic field is also useful in reducing the bandwidth of the lowest triplon band we show it can thus be a flexible theoretical and experimental platform for the correlated bosonic topological system,cond-mat

recent work has raised concerns about the inherent limitations of textonly pretraining in this paper we first demonstrate that reporting bias the tendency of people to not state the obvious is one of the causes of this limitation and then investigate to what extent multimodal training can mitigate this issue to accomplish this we generate the color dataset coda a dataset of humanperceived color distributions for common objects use coda to analyze and compare the color distribution found in text the distribution captured by language models and a humans perception of color and investigate the performance differences between textonly and multimodal models on coda our results show that the distribution of colors that a language model recovers correlates more strongly with the inaccurate distribution found in text than with the groundtruth supporting the claim that reporting bias negatively impacts and inherently limits textonly training we then demonstrate that multimodal models can leverage their visual training to mitigate these effects providing a promising avenue for future research,cs
speed of state transitions in macroscopic systems is a crucial concept for foundations of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as various applications in quantum technology represented by optimal quantum control while extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical processes since mandelstam and tamm speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions have remained elusive here by employing the local conservation law of probability the fundamental principle in physics we develop a general framework for deriving qualitatively tighter speed limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional ones we show for the first time that the speed of the expectation value of an observable defined on an arbitrary graph which can describe general manybody systems is bounded by the gradient of the observable in contrast with conventional speed limits depending on the entire range of the observable this framework enables us to derive novel quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics unlike previous bounds the speed limit decreases when the expectation value of the transition hamiltonian increases this intuitively describes a new tradeoff relation between time and quantum phase difference our bound is dependent on instantaneous quantum states and thus can achieve the equality condition which is conceptually distinct from the liebrobinson bound our work elucidates novel speed limits on the basis of local conservation law providing fundamental limits to various types of nonequilibrium quantum macroscopic phenomena,cond-mat

physicsinformed neural networks pinns have recently emerged as an alternative way of solving partial differential equations pdes without the need of building elaborate grids instead using a straightforward implementation in particular in addition to the deep neural network dnn for the solution a second dnn is considered that represents the residual of the pde the residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the solution in order to formulate the loss function this framework is effective but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the dnn architecture here we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the dnn with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty ie the parametric uncertainty and the approximation uncertainty we first account for the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is represented as a stochastic process multiple dnns are designed to learn the modal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos apc expansion of its solution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors we can then make predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained dnns moreover we employ dropout to correct the overfitting and also to quantify the uncertainty of dnns in approximating the modal functions we then design an active learning strategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place new sensors in the domain to improve the predictions of dnns several numerical tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to quantify the effectiveness of pinns combined with uncertainty quantification this nnapc new paradigm of physicsinformed deep learning with uncertainty quantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic pdes in multidimensions,math

this paper investigates a new analog beamforming architecture for massive multipleinput multipleoutput mimo systems where each of the multiple transmit antennas is switched to be on or off to form a beam according to the channel state information at transmitters this onoff analog beamforming oabf scheme has the advantages in terms of both hardware complexities and algorithmic complexities oabf can completely remove the highcost powerconsuming and bulky analog phaseshifters that are extensively employed by traditional analog beamforming schemes it only requires the deployment of lowcost analog switches that are easy to implement moreover we show that the beams formed by such simple antenna onoff switch operations can achieve rather good performances with lowcomplexity beamforming algorithms specifically we first propose two optimal signaltonoise ratio maximization algorithms to determine the onoff state of each switch under the perantenna power constraint and the total power constraint respectively after that we theoretically prove that oabf can achieve the full diversity gain and the full array gain with complexities up to a polynomial order numerical results are consistent with our theoretical analysis we believe that the simple structure of oabf makes massive mimo much easier to implement in real systems,cs

when quantizing neural networks for efficient inference lowbit integers are the goto format for efficiency however lowbit floating point numbers have an extra degree of freedom assigning some bits to work on an exponential scale instead this paper indepth investigates this benefit of the floating point format for neural network inference we detail the choices that can be made for the fp format including the important choice of the number of bits for the mantissa and exponent and show analytically in which settings these choices give better performance then we show how these findings translate to real networks provide an efficient implementation for fp simulation and a new algorithm that enables the learning of both the scale parameters and the number of exponent bits in the fp format our chief conclusion is that when doing posttraining quantization for a wide range of networks the fp format is better than int in terms of accuracy and the choice of the number of exponent bits is driven by the severity of outliers in the network we also conduct experiments with quantizationaware training where the difference in formats disappears as the network is trained to reduce the effect of outliers,cs

bayesian optimization bo has contributed greatly to improving model performance by suggesting promising hyperparameter configurations iteratively based on observations from multiple training trials however only partial knowledge ie the measured performances of trained models and their hyperparameter configurations from previous trials is transferred on the other hand selfdistillation sd only transfers partial knowledge learned by the task model itself to fully leverage the various knowledge gained from all training trials we propose the boss framework which combines bo and sd boss suggests promising hyperparameter configurations through bo and carefully selects pretrained models from previous trials for sd which are otherwise abandoned in the conventional bo process boss achieves significantly better performance than both bo and sd in a wide range of tasks including general image classification learning with noisy labels semisupervised learning and medical image analysis tasks,cs

solving optimal design problems through crowdsourcing faces a dilemma on one hand human beings have been shown to be more effective than algorithms at searching for good solutions of certain realworld problems with highdimensional or discrete solution spaces on the other hand the cost of setting up crowdsourcing environments the uncertainty in the crowds domainspecific competence and the lack of commitment of the crowd all contribute to the lack of realworld application of design crowdsourcing we are thus motivated to investigate a solutionsearching mechanism where an optimization algorithm is tuned based on human demonstrations on solution searching so that the search can be continued after human participants abandon the problem to do so we model the iterative search process as a bayesian optimization bo algorithm and propose an inverse bo ibo algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimators of the bo parameters based on human solutions we show through a vehicle design and control problem that the search performance of bo can be improved by recovering its parameters based on an effective human search thus ibo has the potential to improve the success rate of design crowdsourcing activities by requiring only good search strategies instead of good solutions from the crowd,cs

so far most studies on the structure of coronal mass ejections cmes are conducted through whitelight coronagraphs which demonstrate about one third of cmes exhibit the typical threepart structure in the high corona eg beyond rs ie the bright front the dark cavity and the bright core in this paper we address the cme structure in the low corona eg below rs through extremeultraviolet euv passbands and find that the threepart cmes in the whitelight images can possess a similar threepart appearance in the euv images ie a leading edge a lowdensity zone and a filament or hot channel the analyses identify that the leading edge and the filament or hot channel in the euv passbands evolve into the front and the core later within several solar radii in the whitelight passbands respectively whats more we find that the cmes without obvious cavity in the whitelight images can also exhibit the clear threepart appearance in the euv images which means that the lowdensity zone in the euv images observed as the cavity in whitelight images can be compressed andor transformed gradually by the expansion of the bright core andor the reconnection of magnetic field surrounding the core during the cme propagation outward our study suggests that more cmes can possess the clear threepart structure in their early eruption stage the nature of the lowdensity zone between the leading edge and the filament or hot channel is discussed,astro-ph
a model based on twopoint closure theory of turbulence is proposed and applied to study the reynolds number dependency of the scalar flux spectra in homogeneous shear flow with a crossstream uniform scalar gradient for the crossstream scalar flux in the inertial range the spectral behavior agrees with classical predictions and measurements the streamwise scalar flux is found to be in good agreement with the results of atmospheric measurements however both the model results and the atmospheric measurements disagree with classical predictions a detailed analysis of the different terms in the evolution equation for the streamwise scalar flux spectrum shows that nonlinear contributions are governing the inertial subrange of this spectrum and that these contributions are relatively more important than for the crossstream flux a new expression for the scalar flux spectra is proposed it allows us to unify the description of the components in one single expression leading to a classical k inertial range for the crossstream component and to a new k scaling for the streamwise component that agrees better with atmospheric measurements than the k prediction of j c wyngaard and o r cote quart j r met soc,physics

this paper proposes a datadriven method for powered prosthesis control that achieves stable walking without the need for additional sensors on the human the key idea is to extract the nominal gait and the human interaction information from motion capture data and reconstruct the walking behavior with a dynamic model of the humanprosthesis system the walking behavior of a human wearing a powered prosthesis is obtained through motion capture which yields the limb and joint trajectories then a nominal trajectory is obtained by solving a gait optimization problem designed to reconstruct the walking behavior observed by motion capture moreover the interaction force profiles between the human and the prosthesis are recovered by simulating the model following the recorded gaits which are then used to construct a force tube that covers all the interaction force profiles finally a robust control lyapunov function clf quadratic programming qp controller is designed to guarantee the convergence to the nominal trajectory under all possible interaction forces within the tube simulation results show this controllers improved tracking performance with a perturbed force profile compared to other control methods with less model information,cs

we present model light curves for accreting black hole candidates bhc based on a recently proposed model for their spectrotemporal properties according to this model the observed light curves and aperiodic variability of bhc are due to a series of soft photon injections at random poisson intervals near the compact object and their reprocessing into hard radiation in an extended but nonuniform hot plasma corona surrounding the compact object we argue that the majority of the timing characteristics of these light curves are due to the stochastic nature of the comptonization process in the extended corona whose properties most notably its radial density dependence are imprinted in them we compute the corresponding power spectral densities psd autocorrelation functions time skewness of the light curves and time lags between the light curves of the sources at different photon energies and compare our results to observation our model light curves compare well with observations providing good fits to their overall morphology as manifest by the autocorrelation and skewness functions the lags and psds of the model light curves are also in good agreement with those observed the model can even accommodate the presence of qpos finally while most of the variability power resides at time scales gsim a few seconds at the same time the model allows also for shots of a few msec in duration in accordance with observation we suggest that refinements of this type of model along with spectral and phase lag information can be used to probe the structure of this class of high energy sources,astro-ph

the low surface brightness lsb spiral ugc is nearly devoid of star formation aside from a large hii region complex located in the extreme outer disc in order to understand the origin and nature of this complex we compare new halpha and archival broadband images of ugc to similar data for four other spiral galaxies we conclude that the extreme offaxis star formation in ugc is likely due to a hyperstable disc that is dark matter dominated at all radii with the toomre parameter reaching a minimum only in the extreme outer disc using analysis strategies designed to be particularly insensitive to the pitfalls of lowsurface brightness objects and small number statistics we determine that the presence of this complex in ugc is not exceptional when the hii region luminosity function is modelled by a power law suggesting that it is a native structure and not a merging satellite however we find that the entire population of hii regions in ugc shows a preference for larger galactocentric radii when compared to hii regions in the other galaxies in our sample ugc dramatically highlights the relationship between the baryonicdark matter ratio and disk stability a threebody interaction similar to a scaleddown version of the interaction suspected to be responsible for malin is consistent with the extreme outer disk star formation that we see in the extended disk of ugc,astro-ph
there are major discrepancies between recent icft intermediate coupling frame transformation and darc dirac atomic rmatrix code calculations fernandezmenchero et al astron astroph a aggarwal et al mon not r astr soc regarding electronimpact excitation rates for transitions in several belike ions as well as claims that the darc calculations are much more accurate and the icft results might even be wrong to identify possible reasons for these discrepancies and to estimate the accuracy of the various results we carried out independent bspline rmatrix bsr calculations for electronimpact excitation of the belike ion n our closecoupling expansions contain the same target states levels overall as the previous icft and darc calculations but the representation of the target wave functions is completely different we find close agreement among all calculations for the strong transitions between lowlying states whereas there remain serious discrepancies for the weak transitions as well as for transitions to highly excited states the differences in the final results for the collision strengths are mainly due to differences in the structure description specifically the inclusion of correlation effects rather than the treatment of relativistic effects or problems with the validity of the three methods to describe the collision hence there is no indication that one approach is superior to another until the convergence of both the target configuration and the closecoupling expansions have been fully established,physics
service robots for the domestic environment are intended to autonomously provide support for their users however stateoftheart robots still often get stuck in failure situations leading to breakdowns in the interaction flow from which the robot cannot recover alone we performed a multiuser wizardofoz experiment in which we manipulated the robots behavior in such a way that it appeared unexpected and malfunctioning and asked participants to help the robot in order to restore the interaction flow we examined how participants reacted to the robots error its subsequent request for help and how it changed their perception of the robot with respect to perceived intelligence likability and task contribution as interaction scenario we used a game of building lego models performed by user dyads in total participants interacted with the robot and helped in malfunctioning situations we report two major findings in user dyads the user who gave the last command followed by the user who is closer is more likely to help malfunctions that can be actively fixed by the user seem not to negatively impact perceived intelligence and likability ratings this work offers insights in how far user support can be a strategy for domestic service robots to recover from repeating malfunctions,cs
obtaining highly accurate depth from stereo images in real time has many applications across computer vision and robotics but in some contexts upper bounds on power consumption constrain the feasible hardware to embedded platforms such as fpgas whilst various stereo algorithms have been deployed on these platforms usually cut down to better match the embedded architecture certain key parts of the more advanced algorithms eg those that rely on unpredictable access to memory or are highly iterative in nature are difficult to deploy efficiently on fpgas and thus the depth quality that can be achieved is limited in this paper we leverage a fpgacpu chip to propose a novel sophisticated stereo approach that combines the best features of sgm and elasbased methods to compute highly accurate dense depth in real time our approach achieves an error rate on the challenging kitti dataset at over fps with a power consumption of only w,cs
we propose and study a continuum model for the dynamics of amorphizable surfaces undergoing ionbeam sputtering ibs at intermediate energies and oblique incidence after considering the current limitations of more standard descriptions in which a single evolution equation is posed for the surface height we overcome some of them by explicitly formulating the dynamics of the species that transport along the surface and by coupling it to that of the surface height proper in this we follow recent proposals inspired by hydrodynamic descriptions of pattern formation in aeolian sand dunes and ionsputtered systems from this enlarged model and by exploiting the timescale separation among various dynamical processes in the system we derive a single height equation in which coefficients can be related to experimental parameters this equation generalizes those obtained by previous continuum models and is able to account for many experimental features of pattern formation by ibs at oblique incidence such as the evolution of the irradiationinduced amorphous layer transverse ripple motion with nonuniform velocity ripple coarsening onset of kinetic roughening and other additionally the dynamics of the full twofield model is compared with that of the effective interface equation,cond-mat

it is well known by now that the threedimensional nonviscous planetary geostrophic model with vertical hydrostatic balance and horizontal rayleigh friction coupled to the heat diffusion and transport is mathematically illposed this is because the nonormal flow physical boundary condition implicitly produces an additional boundary condition for the temperature at the literal boundary this additional boundary condition is different because of the coriolis forcing term than the no heat flux physical boundary condition consequently the second order parabolic heat equation is over determined with two different boundary conditions in a previous work we proposed one remedy to this problem by introducing a fourthorder artificial hyperdiffusion to the heat transport equation and proved global regularity for the proposed model another remedy for this problem was suggested by r salmon by introducing an additional rayleighlike friction term for the vertical component of the velocity in the hydrostatic balance equation in this paper we prove the global for all time and all initial data wellposedness of strong solutions to the threedimensional salmons planetary geostrophic model of ocean dynamics that is we show global existence uniqueness and continuous dependence of the strong solutions on initial data for this model,math

selfdriving vehicles sdvs are becoming reality but still suffer from longtail challenges during natural driving the sdvs will continually encounter rare safetycritical cases that may not be included in the dataset they were trained some safetyassurance planners solve this problem by being conservative in all possible cases which may significantly affect driving mobility to this end this work proposes a method to automatically adjust the conservative level according to each cases longtail rate named dynamically conservative planner dcp we first define the longtail rate as an sdvs confidence to pass a driving case the rate indicates the probability of safecritical events and is estimated using the statistics bootstrapped method with historical data then a reinforcement learningbased planner is designed to contain candidate policies with different conservative levels the final policy is optimized based on the estimated longtail rate in this way the dcp is designed to automatically adjust to be more conservative in lowconfidence longtail cases while keeping efficient otherwise the dcp is evaluated in the carla simulator using driving cases with longtail distributed training data the results show that the dcp can accurately estimate the longtail rate to identify potential risks based on the rate the dcp automatically avoids potential collisions in longtail cases using conservative decisions while not affecting the average velocity in other typical cases thus the dcp is safer and more efficient than the baselines with fixed conservative levels eg an always conservative planner this work provides a technique to guarantee sdvs performance in unexpected driving cases without resorting to a global conservative setting which contributes to solving the longtail problem practically,cs

just as an explicit parameterisation of system dynamics by state ie a choice of coordinates can impede the identification of general structure so it is too with an explicit parameterisation of system dynamics by control however such explicit and fixed parameterisation by control is commonplace in control theory leading to definitions methodologies and results that depend in unexpected ways on control parameterisation in this paper a framework is presented for modelling systems in geometric control theory in a manner that does not make any choice of parameterisation by control the systems are called tautological control systems for the framework to be coherent it relies in a fundamental way on topologies for spaces of vector fields as such classes of systems are considered possessing a variety of degrees of regularity finitely differentiable lipschitz smooth real analytic in each case explicit geometric seminorms are provided for the topologies of spaces of vector fields that enable straightforward descriptions of timevarying vector fields and control systems as part of the development theorems are proved for regular including real analytic dependence on initial conditions of flows of vector fields depending measurably on time classes of ordinary control systems are characterised that interact with the regularity under consideration in a comprehensive way in this framework for example the statement that a smooth or real analytic controlaffine system is a smooth or real analytic control system becomes a theorem correspondences between ordinary control systems and tautological control systems are carefully examined and trajectory correspondence between the two classes is proved for controlaffine systems and for systems with general control dependence when the control set is compact,math

a central quest in explainable ai relates to understanding the decisions made by learned classifiers there are three dimensions of this understanding that have been receiving significant attention in recent years the first dimension relates to characterizing conditions on instances that are necessary and sufficient for decisions therefore providing abstractions of instances that can be viewed as the reasons behind decisions the next dimension relates to characterizing minimal conditions that are sufficient for a decision therefore identifying maximal aspects of the instance that are irrelevant to the decision the last dimension relates to characterizing minimal conditions that are necessary for a decision therefore identifying minimal perturbations to the instance that yield alternate decisions we discuss in this tutorial a comprehensive semantical and computational theory of explainability along these dimensions which is based on some recent developments in symbolic logic the tutorial will also discuss how this theory is particularly applicable to nonsymbolic classifiers such as those based on bayesian networks decision trees random forests and some types of neural networks,cs

current approaches to ab testing in networks focus on limiting interference the concern that treatment effects can spill over from treatment nodes to control nodes and lead to biased causal effect estimation prominent methods for network experiment design rely on twostage randomization in which sparselyconnected clusters are identified and cluster randomization dictates the node assignment to treatment and control here we show that cluster randomization does not ensure sufficient node randomization and it can lead to selection bias in which treatment and control nodes represent different populations of users to address this problem we propose a principled framework for network experiment design which jointly minimizes interference and selection bias we introduce the concepts of edge spillover probability and cluster matching and demonstrate their importance for designing network ab testing our experiments on a number of realworld datasets show that our proposed framework leads to significantly lower error in causal effect estimation than existing solutions,cs

in object detection nonmaximum suppression nms methods are extensively adopted to remove horizontal duplicates of detected dense boxes for generating final object instances however due to the degraded quality of dense detection boxes and not explicit exploration of the context information existing nms methods via simple intersectionoverunion iou metrics tend to underperform on multioriented and longsize objects detection distinguishing with general nms methods via duplicate removal we propose a novel graph fusion network named gfnet for multioriented object detection our gfnet is extensible and adaptively fuse dense detection boxes to detect more accurate and holistic multioriented object instances specifically we first adopt a localityaware clustering algorithm to group dense detection boxes into different clusters we will construct an instance subgraph for the detection boxes belonging to one cluster then we propose a graphbased fusion network via graph convolutional network gcn to learn to reason and fuse the detection boxes for generating final instance boxes extensive experiments both on public available multioriented text datasets including msratd icdar icdarmlt and multioriented object datasets dota verify the effectiveness and robustness of our method against general nms methods in multioriented object detection,cs
we present the smallscale h to h mpc crosscorrelations between luminous earlytype galaxies and a reference sample of million normal galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey our method allows us to construct the spherically averaged realspace crosscorrelation function between the spectroscopic lrg sample and galaxies from the sdss imaging we report the crosscorrelation as a function of scale luminosity and redshift we find very strong luminosity dependences in the clustering amplitudes up to a factor of over a factor of in luminosity and measure this dependence with high signaltonoise ratio the luminosity dependence of bias is found to depend on scale with more variation on smaller scales the clustering as a function of scale is not a power law but instead has a dip at h mpc and an excess on small scales the fraction of red galaxies within the l sample surrounding lrgs is a strong function of scale as expected however the fraction of red galaxies evolves in redshift similarly on small and large scales suggesting that cluster and field populations are changing in the same manner the results highlight the advantage on small scales of using crosscorrelation methods as a means of avoiding shot noise in samples of rare galaxies,astro-ph

wear is well known for causing material loss in a sliding interface available macroscopic approaches are bound to empirical fitting parameters which range several orders of magnitude major advances in tribology have recently been achieved via molecular dynamics although its use is strongly limited by computational cost here we propose a study of the physical processes that lead to wear at the scale of the surface roughness where adhesive junctions are formed between the asperities on the surface of the materials using a brittle formulation of the variational phasefield approach to fracture we demonstrate that the failure mechanisms of an adhesive junction can be linked to its geometry by imposing specific couplings between the damage and the elastic energy we further investigate the triggering processes underlying each failure mechanism we show that a large debris formation is mostly triggered by tensile stresses while shear stresses lead to small or no particle formation we also study groups of junctions and discuss how microcontact interactions can be favored in some geometries to form macroparticles this leads us to propose a classification in terms of macroscopic wear rate although based on a continuum approach our phasefield calculations are able to effectively capture the failure of adhesive junctions as observed through discrete molecular dynamics simulations,cs

this paper studies the influence of electric fields on the skyrmion lattice skl in insulating skyrmion compounds with weak magnetoelectric me coupling the me coupling mechanism is an interaction between the external electric field e and local magnetization in the sample physically the efield perturbs the spin modulation wave vectors resulting in the distortion of the skl and the efield induced shift in energy due to the relativistic smallness of me coupling the important physics is captured already in the elastic proptoe and inelastic proptoe responses in this spirit the effect of the fourthorder cubic anisotropy responsible for stabilization of the skyrmion phase is taken into account perturbatively the shift in energy can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of electric field thus stabilizing or destabilizing the skl phase understanding the efield energetics is important from the viewpoint of creation writing and destruction erasing of skyrmion arrays over the bulk which is paramount for developing skyrmionbased logical elements and data storage,cond-mat

the luminosities of short gamma ray burst host galaxies are anticorrelated with both the isotropic equivalent gamma ray energy and the gamma ray luminosity of the explosions observational selection effects only strengthen the significance of this correlation the correlation may indicate that there are two physically distinct groups of sgrbs if so it requires that the more luminous class of explosions be associated with the younger class of progenitors alternatively it could be due to a continuous distribution of burst and host properties as one possible explanation we find that the effect of binary neutron star masses on inspiral time and energy reservoir produces a correlation of the appropriate sign but does not automatically reproduce the correlation slope or the full range of sgrb energy scales any future model of sgrb progenitors needs to reproduce this correlation,astro-ph

the ability to identify and resolve uncertainty is crucial for the robustness of a dialogue system indeed this has been confirmed empirically on systems that utilise bayesian approaches to dialogue belief tracking however such systems consider only confidence estimates and have difficulty scaling to more complex settings neural dialogue systems on the other hand rarely take uncertainties into account they are therefore overconfident in their decisions and less robust moreover the performance of the tracking task is often evaluated in isolation without consideration of its effect on the downstream policy optimisation we propose the use of different uncertainty measures in neural belief tracking the effects of these measures on the downstream task of policy optimisation are evaluated by adding selected measures of uncertainty to the feature space of the policy and training policies through interaction with a user simulator both human and simulated user results show that incorporating these measures leads to improvements both of the performance and of the robustness of the downstream dialogue policy this highlights the importance of developing neural dialogue belief trackers that take uncertainty into account,cs

any model order reduced dynamical system that evolves a modal decomposition to approximate the discretized solution of a stochastic pde can be related to a vector field tangent to the manifold of fixed rank matrices the dynamically orthogonal do approximation is the canonical reduced order model for which the corresponding vector field is the orthogonal projection of the original system dynamics onto the tangent spaces of this manifold the embedded geometry of the fixed rank matrix manifold is thoroughly analyzed the curvature of the manifold is characterized and related to the smallest singular value through the study of the weingarten map differentiability results for the orthogonal projection onto embedded manifolds are reviewed and used to derive an explicit dynamical system for tracking the truncated singular value decomposition svd of a timedependent matrix it is demonstrated that the error made by the do approximation remains controlled under the minimal condition that the original solution stays close to the low rank manifold which translates into an explicit dependence of this error on the gap between singular values the do approximation is also justified as the dynamical system that applies instantaneously the svd truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the reduced solution riemannian matrix optimization is investigated in this extrinsic framework to provide algorithms that adaptively update the best low rank approximation of a smoothly varying matrix the related gradient flow provides a dynamical system that converges to the truncated svd of an input matrix for almost every initial data,math

a catalytic branching random walk on a multidimensional lattice with arbitrary finite number of catalysts is studied in supercritical regime the dynamics of spatial spread of the particles population is examined upon normalization the components of the vector random walk jump are assumed independent or close to independent and have semiexponential distributions with possibly different parameters a limit theorem on the almost sure normalized positions of the particles at the population front is established contrary to the case of the random walk increments with light distribution tails studied by carmona and hu in onedimensional setting and bulinskaya in multidimensional setting the normalizing factor has a power rate and grows faster than linear in time function the limiting shape of the front in the case of semiexponential tails is nonconvex in contrast to a convex one in the case of light tails,math
mean field game theory studies the behavior of a large number of interacting individuals in a game theoretic setting and has received a lot of attention in the past decade lasry and lions japanese journal of mathematics in this work we derive mean field game partial differential equation systems from deterministic microscopic agent dynamics the dynamics are given by a particular class of ordinary differential equations for which an optimal strategy can be computed bressan milan journal of mathematics we use the concept of nash equilibria and apply the dynamic programming principle to derive the mean field limit equations and we study the scaling behavior of the system as the number of agents tends to infinity and find several mean field game limits especially we avoid in our derivation the notion of measure derivatives novel scales are motivated by an example of an agentbased financial market model,math

we consider an ionic fluid made with two species of mobile particles carrying either a positive or a negative charge we derive a sum rule for the fourth moment of equilibrium charge correlations our method relies on the study of the system response to the potential created by a weak external charge distribution with slow spatial variations the induced particle densities and the resulting induced charge density are then computed within density functional theory where the free energy is expanded in powers of the density gradients the comparison with the predictions of linear response theory provides a thermodynamical expression for the fourth moment of charge correlations which involves the isothermal compressibility as well as suitably defined partial compressibilities the familiar stillingerlovett condition is also recovered as a byproduct of our method suggesting that the fourth moment sum rule should hold in any conducting phase this is explicitly checked in the low density regime within the abemeeron diagrammatical expansions beyond its own interest the fourthmoment sum rule should be useful for both analyzing and understanding recently observed behaviours near the ionic critical point,cond-mat
we consider the problem of learning markov random fields including the prototypical example the ising model under the constraint of differential privacy our learning goals include both structure learning where we try to estimate the underlying graph structure of the model as well as the harder goal of parameter learning in which we additionally estimate the parameter on each edge we provide algorithms and lower bounds for both problems under a variety of privacy constraints namely pure concentrated and approximate differential privacy while nonprivately both learning goals enjoy roughly the same complexity we show that this is not the case under differential privacy in particular only structure learning under approximate differential privacy maintains the nonprivate logarithmic dependence on the dimensionality of the data while a change in either the learning goal or the privacy notion would necessitate a polynomial dependence as a result we show that the privacy constraint imposes a strong separation between these two learning problems in the highdimensional data regime,cs

we study the b rings complex optical depth structure the source of this structure may be the complex dynamics of the keplerian shear and the selfgravity of the ring particles the outcome of these dynamic effects depends sensitively on the collisional and physical properties of the particles two mechanisms can emerge that dominate the macroscopic physical structure of the ring selfgravity wakes and viscous overstability here we study the interplay between these two mechanisms by using our recently developed particle collision method that allows us to better model the interparticle contact physics we find that for a constant ring surface density and particle internal density particles with rough surfaces tend to produce axisymmetric ring features associated with the viscous overstability while particles with smoother surfaces produce selfgravity wakes,astro-ph
for lowdimensional metallic structures such as nanotubes the exchange coupling between localized magnetic dopants is predicted to decay slowly with separation the longrange character of this interaction plays a significant role in determining the magnetic order of the system it has previously been shown that the interaction range depends on the conformation of the magnetic dopants in both graphene and nanotubes here we examine the rkky interaction in carbon nanotubes in the presence of uniaxial strain for a range of different impurity configurations we show that strain is capable of amplifying or attenuating the rkky interaction significantly increasing certain interaction ranges and acting as a switch effectively turning on or off the interaction we argue that uniaxial strain can be employed to significantly manipulate magnetic interactions in carbon nanotubes allowing an interplay between mechanical and magnetic properties in future spintronic devices we also examine the dimensional relationship between graphene and nanotubes with regards to the decay rate of the rkky interaction,cond-mat

an equiangular tight frame etf is a sequence of unitnorm vectors in a euclidean space whose coherence achieves equality in the welch bound and thus yields an optimal packing in a projective space a regular simplex is a simple type of etf in which the number of vectors is one more than the dimension of the underlying space more sophisticated examples include harmonic etfs which equate to difference sets in finite abelian groups recently it was shown that some harmonic etfs are comprised of regular simplices in this paper we continue the investigation into these special harmonic etfs we begin by characterizing when the subspaces that are spanned by the etfs regular simplices form an equiisoclinic tight fusion frame eitff which is a type of optimal packing in a grassmannian space we shall see that every difference set that produces an eitff in this way also yields a complex circulant conference matrix next we consider a subclass of these difference sets that can be factored in terms of a smaller difference set and a relative difference set it turns out that these relative difference sets lend themselves to a second related and yet distinct construction of complex circulant conference matrices finally we provide explicit infinite families of etfs to which this theory applies,math

using the tight binding model and the nonequilibrium green function method we study andreev reflection in graphenesuperconductor junction where graphene has two nonequal dirac cones split in energy and therefore time reversal symmetry is broken due to the antichiral edge states of the current graphene model an incident electron travelling along the edges makes distinct contribution to andreev reflections in a twoterminal device because andreev retroreflection is not allowed for just the antichiral edges in this case the mutual scattering between edge and bulk states is necessary which leads that the coefficient of andreev retroreflection is always symmetrical about the incident energy in a fourterminal junction however the edges are parallel to the interface of superconductor and graphene so at the interface an incident electron travelling along the edges can be retroreflected as a hole into bulk modes or specularly reflected as a hole into antichiral edge states again it is noted that the coefficient of specular andreev reflection keeps symmetric as to the incident energy of electron which is consistent with the reported results before however the coefficient of andreev retroreflection shows an unexpected asymmetrical behavior due to the presence of antichiral edge states our results present some new ideas to study the antichiral edge modes and andreev reflection for a graphene model with the broken time reversal symmetry,cond-mat

chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands the conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the hamiltonian as a constant unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors boundary flat bands enforced by chiral symmetry which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry operator are known to carry fixed pseudospin polarizations and be featureless in quantum geometry in this work we generalize the chiral symmetry and introduce a concept termed subchiral symmetry unlike the conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant the subchiral symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector so as its eigenvectors we show that topological gapped or gapless systems without the chiral symmetry but with the subchiral symmetry can support boundary flat bands which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized berry phases we expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders,cond-mat

in the prequel of this paper kauffman and ogasa introduced new topological quantum invariants of compact oriented manifolds with boundary where the boundary is a disjoint union of two identical surfaces the invariants are constructed via surgery on manifolds of the form f times i where i denotes the unit interval since virtual knots and links are represented as links in such thickened surfaces we are able also to construct invariants in terms of virtual link diagrams planar diagrams with virtual crossings these invariants are new nontrivial and calculable examples of quantum invariants of manifolds with nonvacuous boundary since virtual knots and links are represented by embeddings of circles in thickened surfaces we refer to embeddings of circles in the sphere as it classical links classical links are the same as virtual links that can be represented in a thickened sphere and it is a fact that classical links up to isotopy embed in the collection of virtual links taken up to isotopy we give a new invariant of classical links in the sphere in the following sense consider a link l in s of two components the complement of a tubular neighborhood of l is a manifold whose boundary consists in two copies of a torus our invariants apply to this case of bounded manifold and give new invariants of the given link of two components invariants of knots are also obtained in this paper we calculate the topological quantum invariants of some examples explicitly we conclude from our examples that our invariant is new and strong enough to distinguish some classical knots from one another we also explain how different our topological quantum invariants of manifolds with boundary and the reshetikhinturaev invariants are see the body for detail,math
knowledge distillation is typically conducted by training a small model the student to mimic a large and cumbersome model the teacher the idea is to compress the knowledge from the teacher by using its output probabilities as softlabels to optimize the student however when the teacher is considerably large there is no guarantee that the internal knowledge of the teacher will be transferred into the student even if the student closely matches the softlabels its internal representations may be considerably different this internal mismatch can undermine the generalization capabilities originally intended to be transferred from the teacher to the student in this paper we propose to distill the internal representations of a large model such as bert into a simplified version of it we formulate two ways to distill such representations and various algorithms to conduct the distillation we experiment with datasets from the glue benchmark and consistently show that adding knowledge distillation from internal representations is a more powerful method than only using softlabel distillation,cs
the purpose of this paper is to study radial solutions for steady hydrodynamic model of semiconductors represented by eulerpoisson equations with sonic boundary the existence and uniqueness of radial subsonic solution and the existence of radial supersonic solutions are derived by using the energy method and the compactness method but under a general condition of the doping profile in particular for radial supersonic solutions it is more difficult to get the related estimates by the effect of high dimensional space and the sonic boundary so we apply a special iteration to complete the proofs the results obtained essentially improve and develop the previous studies in the onedimensional case,math

we study the effect of the stochastic character of supernova explosions on the anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays below the knee we conclude that if the bulk of cosmic rays are produced in supernova explosions the observed small and nearly energy independent amplitude of the anisotropy and its phase are to the large extent determined by the history of these explosions in the vicinity of the solar system namely by the location and the age of the supernova remnants within a few kpc which give the highest contribution to the total intensity at the present epoch among the most important factors which result in the small magnitude and the energy independence of the anisotropy amplitude are the mixed primary mass composition the effect of the single source and the galactic halo special attention is given to the phase of the anisotropy it is shown that the excessive flux from the outer galaxy can be due to the location of the solar system at the inner edge of the orion arm which has the enhanced density and rate of supernova explosions,astro-ph
modern reinforcement learning methods suffer from low sample efficiency and unsafe exploration making it infeasible to train robotic policies entirely on real hardware in this work we propose to address the problem of simtoreal domain transfer by using meta learning to train a policy that can adapt to a variety of dynamic conditions and using a taskspecific trajectory generation model to provide an action space that facilitates quick exploration we evaluate the method by performing domain adaptation in simulation and analyzing the structure of the latent space during adaptation we then deploy this policy on a kuka lbr robot and evaluate its performance on a task of hitting a hockey puck to a target our method shows more consistent and stable domain adaptation than the baseline resulting in better overall performance,cs

robotic manipulation stands as a largely unsolved problem despite significant advances in robotics and machine learning in the last decades one of the central challenges of manipulation is partial observability as the agent usually does not know all physical properties of the environment and the objects it is manipulating in advance a recently emerging theory that deals with partial observability in an explicit manner is active inference it does so by driving the agent to act in a way that is not only goaldirected but also informative about the environment in this work we apply active inference to a hardtoexplore simulated robotic manipulation tasks in which the agent has to balance a ball into a target zone since the reward of this task is sparse in order to explore this environment the agent has to learn to balance the ball without any extrinsic feedback purely driven by its own curiosity we show that the informationseeking behavior induced by active inference allows the agent to explore these challenging sparse environments systematically finally we conclude that using an informationseeking objective is beneficial in sparse environments and allows the agent to solve tasks in which methods that do not exhibit directed exploration fail,cs

the representation space of neural models for textual data emerges in an unsupervised manner during training understanding how those representations encode humaninterpretable concepts is a fundamental problem one prominent approach for the identification of concepts in neural representations is searching for a linear subspace whose erasure prevents the prediction of the concept from the representations however while many linear erasure algorithms are tractable and interpretable neural networks do not necessarily represent concepts in a linear manner to identify nonlinearly encoded concepts we propose a kernelization of a linear minimax game for concept erasure we demonstrate that it is possible to prevent specific nonlinear adversaries from predicting the concept however the protection does not transfer to different nonlinear adversaries therefore exhaustively erasing a nonlinearly encoded concept remains an open problem,cs

hereinwe numerically examine the relative dispersion of lagrangian particle pairs in twodimensional inverse energycascade turbulence behind the richardsonobukhov t law of relative separation we discover that the secondorder moment of the relative velocity have a temporal scaling exponent different from the prediction based on the kolmogorovs phenomenology the results also indicate that time evolution of the probability distribution function of the relative velocity is selfsimilar the findings are obtained by enforcing richardsonobukhov law either by considering a special initial separation or by conditional sampling in particular we demonstrate that the conditional sampling removes the initialseparation dependence of the statistics of the separation and relative velocity furthermore we demonstrate that the conditional statistics are robust with respect to the change in the parameters involved and that the number of the removed pairs from the sampling decreases when the reynolds number increases we also discuss the insights gained as a result of conditional sampling,physics

we derive formulas for whispering gallery mode resonances and bending losses in infinite cylindrical dielectric shells and sets of concentric cylindrical shells the formulas also apply to spherical shells and to sections of bent waveguides the derivation is based on a wkb treatment of helmholtz equation and can in principle be extended to any number of concentric shells a distinctive limit analytically arises in the analysis when two shells are brought at very close distance to one another in that limit the two shells act as a slot waveguide if the two shells are sufficiently apart we identify a structural resonance between the individual shells which can either lead to a substantial enhancement or suppression of radiation losses,physics
we propose functional adversarial attacks a novel class of threat models for crafting adversarial examples to fool machine learning models unlike a standard ell_pball threat model a functional adversarial threat model allows only a single function to be used to perturb input features to produce an adversarial example for example a functional adversarial attack applied on colors of an image can change all red pixels simultaneously to light red such global uniform changes in images can be less perceptible than perturbing pixels of the image individually for simplicity we refer to functional adversarial attacks on image colors as recoloradv which is the main focus of our experiments we show that functional threat models can be combined with existing additive ell_p threat models to generate stronger threat models that allow both small individual perturbations and large uniform changes to an input moreover we prove that such combinations encompass perturbations that would not be allowed in either constituent threat model in practice recoloradv can significantly reduce the accuracy of a resnet trained on cifar furthermore to the best of our knowledge combining recoloradv with other attacks leads to the strongest existing attack even after adversarial training an implementation of recoloradv is available at httpsgithubcomcassidylaidlawrecoloradv,cs

contextual synonym knowledge is crucial for those similarityoriented tasks whose core challenge lies in capturing semantic similarity between entities in their contexts such as entity linking and entity matching however most pretrained language models plms lack synonym knowledge due to inherent limitations of their pretraining objectives such as masked language modeling mlm existing works which inject synonym knowledge into plms often suffer from two severe problems i neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms and ii undermining semantic understanding of original plms which is caused by inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus to address these issues we propose picso a flexible framework that supports the injection of contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into plms via a novel entityaware adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities synonyms in the contexts meanwhile picso stores the synonym knowledge in additional parameters of the adapter structure which prevents it from corrupting the semantic understanding of the original plm extensive experiments demonstrate that picso can dramatically outperform the original plms and the other knowledge and synonym injection models on four different similarityoriented tasks in addition experiments on glue prove that picso also benefits general natural language understanding tasks codes and data will be public,cs

the concept of a random walk on a finite group converging to random and a way of measuring the distance to random after k transitions is generalised from the classical case to the case of random walks on finite quantum groups a central tool in the study of ergodic random walks on finite groups is the upper bound lemma of diaconis and shahshahani the upper bound lemma uses the representation theory of the group to generate upper bounds for the distance to random and thus can be used to determine convergence rates for ergodic walks the representation theory of quantum groups is very well understood and is remarkably similar to the representation theory of classical groups this allows for a generalisation of the upper bound lemma to an upper bound lemma for quantum groups the quantum diaconisshahshahani upper bound lemma is used to study the convergence of ergodic random walks on classical groups mathbbz_n mathbbz_n the dual group widehats_n as well as the truly quantum groups of kac paljutkin and sekine,math

detecting fraudulent transactions is an essential component to control risk in ecommerce marketplaces apart from rulebased and machine learning filters that are already deployed in production we want to enable efficient realtime inference with graph neural networks gnns which is useful to catch multihop risk propagation in a transaction graph however two challenges arise in the implementation of gnns in production first future information in a dynamic graph should not be considered in message passing to predict the past second the latency of graph query and gnn model inference is usually up to hundreds of milliseconds which is costly for some critical online services to tackle these challenges we propose a batch and realtime inception graph topology bright framework to conduct an endtoend gnn learning that allows efficient online realtime inference bright framework consists of a graph transformation module twostage directed graph and a corresponding gnn architecture lambda neural network the twostage directed graph guarantees that the information passed through neighbors is only from the historical payment transactions it consists of two subgraphs representing historical relationships and realtime links respectively the lambda neural network decouples inference into two stages batch inference of entity embeddings and realtime inference of transaction prediction our experiments show that bright outperforms the baseline models by in average wrtprecision furthermore bright is computationally efficient for realtime fraud detection regarding endtoend performance including neighbor query and inference bright can reduce the p latency by for the inference stage our speedup is on average times compared to the traditional gnn,cs

in this work we explore the effects of adopting initial mass functions imfs variable in time on the chemical evolution of the galaxy in order to do that we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes for the formation of the galaxy and which proved to be successful in reproducing the majority of the observational constraints at least for the case of a constant imf different variable imfs are tested with this model all assuming that massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity this implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and at large galactocentric distances our numerical results have shown that all the variable imfs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevant observational constraints in the galaxy and that a constant imf still reproduces better the observations in particular variable imfs of the kind explored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients even when allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as for instance the star formation rate as a consequence of this we conclude that the gdwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large timescale and a constant imf since it is possible to find variable imfs of the kind studied here reproducing the gdwarf metallicity but this worsen the agreement with other observational constraints,astro-ph

a large majority of cellular networks deployed today make use of frequency division duplexing fdd where in contrast with time division duplexing tdd the channel reciprocity does not hold and explicit downlink dl probing and uplink ul feedback are needed in order to achieve spatial multiplexing gain to support massive mimo the overhead incurred by conventional dl probing and ul feedback schemes scales linearly with the number of bs antennas and therefore may be very large in this paper we present a new approach to achieve a very competitive tradeoff between spatial multiplexing gain and probingfeedback overhead in such systems our approach is based on two novel methods i an efficient regularization technique based on deep neural networks dnn that learns the angular spread function asf of users channels and permits to estimate the dl covariance matrix from the noisy iid channel observations obtained freely via ul pilots uldl covariance transformation ii a novel sparsifying precoding technique that uses the estimated dl covariance matrix from i and imposes a controlled sparsity on the dl channel such that given any assigned dl pilot dimension it is able to find an optimal sparsity level and a corresponding sparsifying precoder for which the effective channel vectors after sparsification can be estimated at the bs with a low meansquare error we compare our proposed dnnbased method in i with other methods in the literature via numerical simulations and show that it yields a very competitive performance we also compare our sparsifying precoder in ii with the stateoftheart statistical beamforming methods under the assumption that those methods also have access to the covariance knowledge in the dl and show that our method yields higher spectral efficiency since it uses in addition the instantaneous channel information after sparsification,cs

classical first order fo algorithms of convex optimization such as mirror descent algorithm or nesterovs optimal algorithm of smooth convex optimization are well known to have optimal theoretical complexity estimates which do not depend on the problem dimension however to attain the optimality the domain of the problem should admit a good proximal setup the latter essentially means that the problem domain should satisfy certain geometric conditions of favorable geometry and the practical use of these methods is conditioned by our ability to compute at a moderate cost em proximal transformation at each iteration more often than not these two conditions are satisfied in optimization problems arising in computational learning what explains why proximal type fo methods recently became methods of choice when solving various learning problems yet they meet their limits in several important problems such as multitask learning with large number of tasks where the problem domain does not exhibit favorable geometry and learning and matrix completion problems with nuclear norm constraint when the numerical cost of computing proximal transformation becomes prohibitive in largescale problems we propose a novel approach to solving nonsmooth optimization problems arising in learning applications where fencheltype representation of the objective function is available the approach is based on applying fo algorithms to the dual problem and using the em accuracy certificates supplied by the method to recover the primal solution while suboptimal in terms of accuracy guaranties the proposed approach does not rely upon good proximal setup for the primal problem but requires the problem domain to admit a linear optimization oracle the ability to efficiently maximize a linear form on the domain of the primal problem,math

the decrease in star formation sf and the morphological change necessary to produce the z elliptical galaxy population are commonly ascribed to a sudden quenching event which is able to rid the central galaxy of its cold gas reservoir in a short time following this event the galaxy is able to prevent further sf and stay quiescent via a maintenance mode we test whether such a quenching event is truly necessary using a simple model of quiescence in this model hot gas all gas above a temperature threshold in a sim m_odot halo mass galaxy at redshift zsim is prevented from cooling the cool gas continues to form stars at a decreasing rate and the galaxy stellar mass morphology velocity dispersion and position on the color magnitude diagram cmd proceed to evolve by z the halo mass has grown to m_odot and the galaxy has attained characteristics typical of an observed z elliptical galaxy our model is run in the framework of a cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamic code which includes sf early stellar feedback supernova feedback metal cooling and metal diffusion additionally we postprocess our simulations with a radiative transfer code to create a mock cmd in contrast to previous assumptions that a pure fade away model evolves too slowly to account for the sparsity of galaxies in the green valley we demonstrate crossing times of gyr we conclude that no sudden quenching event is necessary to produce such rapid colour transitions,astro-ph

we analyse highresolution vltuves spectra of the lowionization intrinsic absorber observed in the bal qso sdss j two narrow absorption systems at velocities kms and kms are detected the lowvelocity system is part of the broad absorption line bal while the highvelocity one is well detached while most narrow absorption components are only detected in the highionization species the lowest velocity component is detected in both high and lowionization species including in the excited siii and cii lines from the analysis of doublet lines we find that the narrow absorption lines at the lowvelocity end of the bal trough are completely saturated but do not reach zero flux their profiles being dominated by a velocitydependent covering factor the covering factor is significantly smaller for mgii than for siiv and nv which demonstrates the intrinsic nature of absorber from the analysis of the excited siii and cii lines in the lowest velocity component we find an electron density cm assuming photoionization equilibrium we derive a distance kpc between the lowionization region and the quasar core the correspondence in velocity of the high and lowionization features suggests that all these species must be closely associated hence formed at the same distance of kpc much higher than the distance usually assumed for bal absorbers,astro-ph
the mechanical response of almost pure singlecrystal micropillars under compression exhibits a highly localized behavior that can endanger the structural stability of a sample recent experiments revealed that the mechanical response of a crystal is very sensitive to both the presence of a quenched disorder in the sample and the orientation of the crystal in this work we study the influence of disorder and crystal orientation on the large strain response of a d fcc crystal with three active glide planes using a very simple eulerian plasticity model in the fe framework our numerical and theoretical results on clean crystal pillars suggest that a single plane or many gliding planes can be activated depending on the crystal orientation while in the former case the deformation is localized leading to ductile rupture in the latter a complex interplay between active planes takes place resulting in a more uniform deformation the strainlocalization can be avoided when inhomogeneities are engineered inside the crystal or the crystal orientation is altered because of the activation of multiple slip systems resulting in a patchwork of the distribution of the slip systems,cond-mat
in this article we present a nanoelectromechanical system nems designed to detect changes in the casimir energy the casimir effect is a result of the appearance of quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic vacuum previous experiments have used nano or micro scale parallel plate capacitors to detect the casimir force by measuring the small attractive force these fluctuations exert between the two surfaces in this new set of experiments we aim to directly detect shifts in the casimir textitenergy in the vacuum due to the presence of metallic parallel plates one of which is a superconductor a change in the casimir energy of this configuration is predicted to shift the superconducting transition temperature t_textrmc because of an interaction between it and the superconducting condensation energy the experiment we discuss consists of taking a superconducting film carefully measuring its transition temperature bringing a conducting plate close to the film creating a casimir cavity and then measuring the transition temperature again the expected shifts will be small comparable to the normal shifts one sees in cycling superconducting films to cryogenic temperatures and so using a nems resonator and doing this in situ is the only practical way to obtain accurate reproducible data using a thin pb film and opposing au surface we observe no shift in t_textrmc greater than muk down to a minimum spacing of approximately nm,physics

we address the development of geometric phases in classical and quantum magnetic moments spin precessing in an external magnetic field we show that nonadiabatic dynamics lead to a topological phase transition determined by a change in the driving field topology the transition is associated with an effective geometric phase which is identified from the paths of the magnetic moments in a spherical geometry the topological transition presents close similarities between so and su cases but features differences in eg the adiabatic limits of the geometric phases being pi and pi in the classical and the quantum case respectively we discuss possible experiments where the effective geometric phase would be observable,cond-mat
the thermodynamic formalism allows one to access the chaotic properties of equilibrium and outofequilibrium systems by deriving those from a dynamical partition function the definition that has been given for this partition function within the framework of discrete time markov chains was not suitable for continuous time markov dynamics here we propose another interpretation of the definition that allows us to apply the thermodynamic formalism to continuous time we also generalize the formalism a dynamical gibbs ensemble construction to a whole family of observables and their associated large deviation functions this allows us to make the connection between the thermodynamic formalism and the observable involved in the muchstudied fluctuation theorem we illustrate our approach on various physical systems random walks exclusion processes an ising model and the contact process in the latter cases we identify a signature of the occurrence of dynamical phase transitions we show that this signature can already be unravelled using the simplest dynamical ensemble one could define based on the number of configuration changes a system has undergone over an asymptotically large time window,cond-mat

we introduce combinatory homomorphic automatic differentiation chad a principled pure provably correct definethenrun method for performing forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation ad on programming languages with expressive features it implements ad as a compositional typerespecting sourcecode transformation that generates purely functional code this code transformation is principled in the sense that it is the unique homomorphic structure preserving extension to expressive languages of elliotts wellknown and unambiguous definitions of ad for a firstorder functional language correctness of the method follows by a compositional logical relations argument that shows that the semantics of the syntactic derivative is the usual calculus derivative of the semantics of the original program in their most elegant formulation the transformations generate code with linear types however the code transformations can be implemented in a standard functional language lacking linear types while the correctness proof requires tracking of linearity the actual transformations do not in fact even in a standard functional language we can get all of the typesafety that linear types give us we can implement all linear types used to type the transformations as abstract types by using a basic module system in this paper we detail the method when applied to a simple higherorder language for manipulating statically sized arrays however we explain how the methodology applies more generally to functional languages with other expressive features finally we discuss how the scope of chad extends beyond applications in ad to other dynamic program analyses that accumulate data in a commutative monoid,cs
the eigenvalue pdf for some well known classes of nonhermitian random matrices the complex ginibre ensemble for example can be interpreted as the boltzmann factor for onecomponent plasma systems in twodimensional domains we address this theme in a systematic fashion identifying the plasma system for the ginibre ensemble of nonhermitian gaussian random matrices g the spherical ensemble of the product of an inverse ginibre matrix and a ginibre matrix g_ g_ and the ensemble formed by truncating unitary matrices as well as for products of such matrices we do this when each has either real complex or real quaternion elements one consequence of this analogy is that the leading form of the eigenvalue density follows as a corollary another is that the eigenvalue correlations must obey sum rules known to characterise the plasma system and this leads us to a exhibit an integral identity satisfied by the twoparticle correlation for real quaternion matrices in the neighbourhood of the real axis further random matrix ensembles investigated from this viewpoint are self dual nonhermitian matrices in which a previous study has related to the onecomponent plasma system in a disk at inverse temperature beta and the ensemble formed by the single row and column of quaternion elements from a member of the circular symplectic ensemble,math-ph

we reexamine the usefulness of fitting blended lightcurve models to microlensing photometric data we find agreement with previous workers eg wozniak paczynski that this is a difficult proposition because of the degeneracy of blend fraction with other fit parameters we show that followup observations at specific point along the lightcurve peak region and wings of high magnification events are the most helpful in removing degeneracies we also show that very small errors in the baseline magnitude can result in problems in measuring the blend fraction and study the importance of nongaussian errors in the fit results the biases and skewness in the distribution of the recovered blend fraction is discussed we also find a new approximation formula relating the blend fraction and the unblended fit parameters to the underlying event duration needed to estimate microlensing optical depth,astro-ph

in this work we focus on two questions one we complement the machinary to calculate geometric phases along adiabatic cycles as follows the geometric phase is a line integral along an adiabatic cycle and if the cycle encircles a degeneracy point the phase becomes nontrivial if the cycle crosses the degeneracy point the phase diverges we construct quantities which are welldefined when the path crosses the degeneracy point we do this by constructing a generalized bargmann invariant and noting that it can be interpreted as a cumulant generating function with the geometric phase being the first cumulant we show that particular ratios of cumulants remain finite for cycles crossing a set of isolated degeneracy points the cumulant ratios take the form of the binder cumulants known from the theory of finite size scaling in statistical mechanics we name them geometric binder cumulants two we show that the machinery developed can be applied to perform finite size scaling in the context of the modern theory of polarization the geometric binder cumulants are size independent at gap closure points or regions with closed gap luttinger liquid we demonstrate this by model calculations for a onedimensional topological model several twodimensional models and a onedimensional correlated model in the case of two dimensions we analyze to different situations one in which the fermi surface is onedimensional a line and two cases in which it is zero dimensional dirac points for the geometric binder cumulants the gap closure points can be found by one dimensional scaling even in two dimensions as a technical point we stress that only certain finite difference approximations for the cumulants are applicable since not all approximation schemes are capable of extracting the size scaling information in the case of a closed gap system,cond-mat

radiation pressuredominated accretion disks are predicted to exhibit strong density inhomogeneities on scales much smaller than the disk scale height due to the nonlinear development of photon bubble instability radiation would escape from such a leaky disk at a rate higher than that predicted by standard accretion disk theory the disk scale height is then smaller than that of a similar disk without smallscale inhomogeneities and the disk can remain geometrically thin even as the flux approaches and exceeds the eddington limit an idealized onezone model for disks with radiationdriven inhomogeneities suggests that the escaping flux could exceed l_e by a factor of up to depending on the mass of the central object such luminous disks would develop strong mass loss but the resulting decrease in accretion rate would not necessarily prevent the luminosity from exceeding l_e we suggest that the observed ultraluminous xray sources are actually thin supereddington accretion disks orbiting stellarmass black holes and need not indicate the existence of a class of intermediatemass black holes,astro-ph
