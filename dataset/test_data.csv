a flutter machine is introduced for the investigation of a singular interface between the classical and reversible hopf bifurcations that is theoretically predicted to be generic in nonconservative reversible systems with vanishing dissipation in particular such a singular interface exists for the pfluger viscoelastic column moving in a resistive medium which is proven by means of the perturbation theory of multiple eigenvalues with the jordan block the laboratory setup consisting of a cantilevered viscoelastic rod loaded by a positional force with nonzero curl produced by dry friction demonstrates high sensitivity of the classical hopf bifurcation onset to the ratio between the weak air drag and kelvinvoigt damping in the pfluger column thus the whitney umbrella singularity is experimentally confirmed responsible for discontinuities accompanying dissipationinduced instabilities in a broad range of physical contexts,physics
nitrogen reduction reaction nrr which converts nitrogen n to ammonia nh normally requires harsh conditions to break the bound nitrogen bond herein via firstprinciples calculation we reveal that a superior nrr catalytic activity could be obtained through anchoring atomic catalyst above a phosphorenelike puckering surface of germanium selenide gese through examining the single and double atoms b fe w mo and ru decorated on gese we find that its rippled structure allows an intimate contact between the deposited species and the gese which significantly promotes the states hybridization amongst the various atomic catalyst we predict that the ru dimer decorated gese monolayer rugese has superior catalytic activity for the n fixation and reduction through examining the three nrr pathways distal alternating and enzymatic the distal and enzymatic pathway is both the thermodynamically favorable with the maximum gibbs free energy change deltagmax of and ev respectively such a superior activity could be attributed to the filtered states of gese by ru dimer which leads to the effective activation of the adsorbed n bond as an efficient nearinfrared absorber of gese the ru mediated hybridization of geserun complex enables an ingap state which further broadens the absorbing window rendering for a broadband solar absorption and possible photocatalysis,cond-mat
let r be an arbitrary subset of a commutative ring we introduce a combinatorial model for the set of tame frieze patterns with entries in r based on a notion of irreducibility of frieze patterns when r is a ring then a frieze pattern is reducible if and only if it contains an entry not on the border which is or to my knowledge this model generalizes simultaneously all previously presented models for tame frieze patterns bounded by s and s,math

experimental data suggests that at temperatures below k the pressure in liquid helium has a cubic dependence on density thus the speed of sound scales as a cubic root of pressure near a critical pressure point this speed approaches zero whereby the critical pressure is negative thus indicating a cavitation instability regime we demonstrate that to explain this dependence one has to view liquid helium as a mixture of three quantum bose liquids dilute grosspitaevskiitype boseeinstein condensate ginzburgsobyanintype fluid and logarithmic superfluid therefore the dynamics of such a mixture is described by a quantum wave equation which contains not only the polynomial grosspitaevskii and ginzburgsobyanin nonlinearities with respect to a condensate wavefunction but also a nonpolynomial logarithmic nonlinearity we derive an equation of state and speed of sound in our model and show their agreement with experiment,cond-mat

the symmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem sniep asks which sets of numbers counting multiplicities can be the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix with nonnegative entries while examples of such matrices are abundant in linear algebra and various applications this question is still open for matrices of dimension ngeq one of the approaches to solve the sniep was proposed by george w soules relying on a specific type of eigenvectors soules vectors to derive sufficient conditions for this problem elsner et al later showed a canonical way to construct all soules vectors based on binary rooted trees while soules vectors are typically treated as a totally ordered set of vectors we propose in this article to consider a relaxed alternative a partially ordered set of soules vectors we show that this perspective enables a more complete characterization of the sufficient conditions for the sniep in particular we show that the set of eigenvalues that satisfy these sufficient conditions is a convex cone with symmetries corresponding to the automorphisms of the binary rooted tree from which the soules vectors were constructed as a second application we show how soules vectors can be used to construct graph laplacian matrices with a given spectrum and describe a number of interesting connections with the concepts of hierarchical random graphs equitable partitions and effective resistance,physics
effects of impurity scatterings on the conductance in normalmetal d wave superconductor junctions are discussed by using the singlesite approximation so far the split of the zerobias conductance peak has been believed to be an evidence of the broken time reversal symmetry states at the surface of hight_c superconductors in this paper however it is shown that the impurity scattering near the interface also causes the split of the zerobias conductance peak typical conductance spectra observed in experiments at finite temperatures and under external magnetic fields are explained well by the present theory,cond-mat
the tidally tilted pulsators are a new type of oscillating star in close binary systems that have their pulsation axis in the orbital plane because of the tidal distortion caused by their companion we describe this group of stars on the basis of the first three representatives discovered and illustrate the basic methods used for their analysis their value for astrophysical study is rooted in the combination of the strengths of binary star and asteroseismic analyses pulsational mode identifications can be achieved because the oscillations are visible over nearly degrees of aspect throughout the orbital cycle an illustrative case of a particularly interesting system is presented,astro-ph
we introduce an effective dimer tightbinding model for the family of shastrysutherland models with geometrically tunable triplon excitations the rashba pseudospinorbit coupling induced by the tilted external magnetic field leads to elementary excitations having nontrivial topological properties with piberry flux the interplay between the inplane and outofplane magnetic field thus allows us to effectively engineer the band structure in this bosonic system in particular the inplane magnetic field gives rise to berry curvature hotspot near the bottom of the triplon band and at the same time significantly increases the critical magnetic field for the topological triplon band we calculate explicitly the experimental signature of the thermal hall effect of triplons in srcubo and show a pronounced and tunabled transport signals within the accessible parameter range particularly with a change of sign of the thermal hall conductance the tilted magnetic field is also useful in reducing the bandwidth of the lowest triplon band we show it can thus be a flexible theoretical and experimental platform for the correlated bosonic topological system,cond-mat

this paper measures similarity both within and between language varieties across nine languages these corpora are drawn from digital sources the web and tweets allowing us to evaluate whether such georeferenced corpora are reliable for modelling linguistic variation the basic idea is that if each source adequately represents a single underlying language variety then the similarity between these sources should be stable across all languages and countries the paper shows that there is a consistent agreement between these sources using frequencybased corpus similarity measures this provides further evidence that digital georeferenced corpora consistently represent local language varieties,cs
the mechanisms involved in the polarization switching process in soft and hard pbzr tio pzt bulk ceramics were investigated through the dependency of the hysteresis loop on the frequency in order to determine the influence of the defects on the domain switching dynamics the samples were characterized in the virgin state and after a fatigue or a depinning process the frequency dependence of the polarization revealed a strong relaxation of the domain walls at hz the results also revealed a strong influence of the kind of defect and their distribution into the ferroelectric matrix on the domain switching dynamics which reflected in the frequency dependence of the coercive field and the percentage of the backswitching initially it was observed that the frequency dependence of the coercive field for the soft and the hard pzt in the virgin state had just one rate of change per decade in all frequency range investigated which is the standard behavior found in the literature however after the fatigue or the depinning process two rates of changes were noticed consequently an evidence of an upper frequency limit for the coercive field changes was found the percentage of the backswitching and its behavior for the soft pzt was almost independent of the fatigue state in all frequency range investigated nevertheless for the hard pzt an opposite behavior was verified the reorientation of the domains was modeled as occurring in a viscous medium where several forces such as viscous and restoring forces act on them,cond-mat

the eigenvalue pdf for some well known classes of nonhermitian random matrices the complex ginibre ensemble for example can be interpreted as the boltzmann factor for onecomponent plasma systems in twodimensional domains we address this theme in a systematic fashion identifying the plasma system for the ginibre ensemble of nonhermitian gaussian random matrices g the spherical ensemble of the product of an inverse ginibre matrix and a ginibre matrix g_ g_ and the ensemble formed by truncating unitary matrices as well as for products of such matrices we do this when each has either real complex or real quaternion elements one consequence of this analogy is that the leading form of the eigenvalue density follows as a corollary another is that the eigenvalue correlations must obey sum rules known to characterise the plasma system and this leads us to a exhibit an integral identity satisfied by the twoparticle correlation for real quaternion matrices in the neighbourhood of the real axis further random matrix ensembles investigated from this viewpoint are self dual nonhermitian matrices in which a previous study has related to the onecomponent plasma system in a disk at inverse temperature beta and the ensemble formed by the single row and column of quaternion elements from a member of the circular symplectic ensemble,math-ph

nonautoregressive nar text generation models have drawn much attention because of their significantly faster decoding speed and good generation quality in machine translation however in a wider range of text generation tasks existing nar models lack proper pretraining making them still far behind the pretrained autoregressive models in this paper we propose pretrained directed acyclic transformer predat and a novel pretraining task to promote prediction consistency in nar generation experiments on five text generation tasks show that our predat remarkably outperforms existing pretrained nar models scores on average and even achieves better results than pretrained autoregressive baselines in ngrambased metrics along with times speedup in throughput further analysis shows that predat benefits from the unbiased prediction order that alleviates the error accumulation problem in autoregressive generation which provides new insights into the advantages of nar generation,cs

super soft source sss spectra are powered by nuclear burning on the surface of a white dwarf the released energy causes a radiativelydriven wind that leads to a radially extended atmosphere around the white dwarf significant blue shifts in photospheric absorption lines are found in the spectra of novae during their sss phase being an evidence of continued mass loss in this phase we present spherically symmetric phoenix models that account for the expansion of the ejecta a comparison to a plane parallel hydrostatic atmosphere model demonstrates that the mass loss can have a significant impact on the model spectra the dynamic model yields less pronounced absorption edges and harder xray spectra are the result therefore lower effective temperatures are needed to explain the observed spectra although both types of models are yet to be finetuned in order to accurately determine best fit parameters the implications on the chemical abundances are going in opposite directions with the expanding models the requirement for strong depletion of the crucial elements that cause these edges is now avoidable,astro-ph

in this work we focus on two questions one we complement the machinary to calculate geometric phases along adiabatic cycles as follows the geometric phase is a line integral along an adiabatic cycle and if the cycle encircles a degeneracy point the phase becomes nontrivial if the cycle crosses the degeneracy point the phase diverges we construct quantities which are welldefined when the path crosses the degeneracy point we do this by constructing a generalized bargmann invariant and noting that it can be interpreted as a cumulant generating function with the geometric phase being the first cumulant we show that particular ratios of cumulants remain finite for cycles crossing a set of isolated degeneracy points the cumulant ratios take the form of the binder cumulants known from the theory of finite size scaling in statistical mechanics we name them geometric binder cumulants two we show that the machinery developed can be applied to perform finite size scaling in the context of the modern theory of polarization the geometric binder cumulants are size independent at gap closure points or regions with closed gap luttinger liquid we demonstrate this by model calculations for a onedimensional topological model several twodimensional models and a onedimensional correlated model in the case of two dimensions we analyze to different situations one in which the fermi surface is onedimensional a line and two cases in which it is zero dimensional dirac points for the geometric binder cumulants the gap closure points can be found by one dimensional scaling even in two dimensions as a technical point we stress that only certain finite difference approximations for the cumulants are applicable since not all approximation schemes are capable of extracting the size scaling information in the case of a closed gap system,cond-mat

xray time lags are complicated in nature the exact reasons for complex lag spectra are yet to be known however the hard lags in general are believed to be originated due to the inverse comptonization process but the origin of soft lags remained mischievous recent studies on diskjet connections revealed that the jets are also contributing to the xray spectral and timing properties in a magnitude which was more than what was predicted earlier in this article we first show an exact anticorrelation between xray time lag and radio flux for xte j during its outburst we propose that the soft lags might be generated due to the change in the accretion disk structure along the line of sight during higher jet activity,astro-ph

matching corresponding features between two images is a fundamental task to computer vision with numerous applications in object recognition robotics and d reconstruction current state of the art in image feature matching has focused on establishing a single consistency in static scenes by contrast finding multiple consistencies in dynamic scenes has been underresearched in this paper we present an endtoend optimization framework named iterative clustering with gametheoretic matching icgtm for robust multiconsistency correspondence the key idea is to formulate multiconsistency matching as a generalized clustering problem for an image pair in our formulation several local matching games are simultaneously carried out in different corresponding block pairs under the guidance of a novel payoff function consisting of both geometric and descriptive compatibility the global matching results are further iteratively refined by clustering and thresholding with respect to a payoff matrix we also propose three new metrics for evaluating the performance of multiconsistency image feature matching extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms previous stateoftheart approaches on both singleconsistency and multiconsistency datasets,cs
exciton dispersion as a function of centerofmass momentum textbfq is essential to the understanding of exciton dynamics we use the abinitio gwbethe salpeter equation method to calculate the dispersion of excitons in monolayer mos_ and find a nonanalytic lightlike dispersion this behavior arises from an unusual q term in both the intra and intervalley exchange of the electronhole interaction which concurrently gives rise to a valley quantum phase of winding number two a simple effective hamiltonian to q order with analytic solutions is derived to describe quantitatively these behaviors,cond-mat
as the technological advancement and capabilities of automated systems have increased drastically the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles for performing humandependent tasks without human indulgence has also spiked since unmanned aerial vehicles are heavily dependent on information and communication technology they are highly prone to cyberattacks with time more advanced and new attacks are being developed and employed however the current intrusion detection system lacks detection and classification of new and unknown attacks therefore for having an autonomous and reliable operation of unmanned aerial vehicles more robust and automated cyber detection and protection schemes are needed to address this we have proposed an autonomous selfincremental learning architecture capable of detecting known and unknown cyberattacks on its own without any human interference in our approach we have combined signaturebased detection along with anomaly detection in such a way that the signaturebased detector autonomously updates its attack classes with the help of an anomaly detector to achieve this we have implemented an incremental learning approach updating our model to incorporate new classes without forgetting the old ones to validate the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed architecture we have implemented it in a trial scenario and then compared it with the traditional offline learning approach moreover our anomalybased detector has achieved a detection rate for attacks,cs
neural networks nns are currently changing the computational paradigm on how to combine data with mathematical laws in physics and engineering in a profound way tackling challenging inverse and illposed problems not solvable with traditional methods however quantifying errors and uncertainties in nnbased inference is more complicated than in traditional methods this is because in addition to aleatoric uncertainty associated with noisy data there is also uncertainty due to limited data but also due to nn hyperparameters overparametrization optimization and sampling errors as well as model misspecification although there are some recent works on uncertainty quantification uq in nns there is no systematic investigation of suitable methods towards quantifying the total uncertainty effectively and efficiently even for function approximation and there is even less work on solving partial differential equations and learning operator mappings between infinitedimensional function spaces using nns in this work we present a comprehensive framework that includes uncertainty modeling new and existing solution methods as well as evaluation metrics and posthoc improvement approaches to demonstrate the applicability and reliability of our framework we present an extensive comparative study in which various methods are tested on prototype problems including problems with mixed inputoutput data and stochastic problems in high dimensions in the appendix we include a comprehensive description of all the uq methods employed which we will make available as opensource library of all codes included in this framework,cs
outofdistribution detection is crucial to the safe deployment of machine learning systems currently unsupervised outofdistribution detection is dominated by generativebased approaches that make use of estimates of the likelihood or other measurements from a generative model reconstructionbased methods offer an alternative approach in which a measure of reconstruction error is used to determine if a sample is outofdistribution however reconstructionbased approaches are less favoured as they require careful tuning of the models information bottleneck such as the size of the latent dimension to produce good results in this work we exploit the view of denoising diffusion probabilistic models ddpm as denoising autoencoders where the bottleneck is controlled externally by means of the amount of noise applied we propose to use ddpms to reconstruct an input that has been noised to a range of noise levels and use the resulting multidimensional reconstruction error to classify outofdistribution inputs we validate our approach both on standard computervision datasets and on higher dimension medical datasets our approach outperforms not only reconstructionbased methods but also stateoftheart generativebased approaches code is available at httpsgithubcommarksgrahamddpmood,cs

prompttuning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pretrained models to downstream tasks or aligning with human preferences prompt learning is widely used in nlp but has limited applicability to rl due to the complex physical meaning and environmentspecific information contained within rl prompts these factors require supervised learning to imitate the demonstrations and may result in a loss of meaning after learning additionally directly extending prompttuning approaches to rl is challenging because rl prompts guide agent behavior based on environmental modeling and analysis rather than filling in missing information making it unlikely that adjustments to the prompt format for downstream tasks as in nlp can yield significant improvements in this work we propose the prompttuning dt algorithm to address these challenges by using trajectory segments as prompts to guide rl agents in acquiring environmental information and optimizing prompts via blackbox tuning to enhance their ability to contain more relevant information thereby enabling agents to make better decisions our approach involves randomly sampling a gaussian distribution to finetune the elements of the prompt trajectory and using preference ranking function to find the optimization direction thereby providing more informative prompts and guiding the agent towards specific preferences in the target environment extensive experiments show that with only of the parameters learned prompttuning dt achieves comparable or even better performance than fullmodel finetuning in lowdata scenarios our work contributes to the advancement of prompttuning approaches in rl providing a promising direction for optimizing large rl agents for specific preference tasks,cs
thomas youngs slit experiment lies at the heart of classical interference and quantum mechanics over the last fifty years it has been shown that particles eg photons electrons large molecules even individual particles generate an interference pattern at a distant screen after passage through a double slit thereby demonstrating waveparticle duality we revisit this famous experiment by replacing both slits with singlemode fibre inputs to two independent quantum memories that are capable of storing the incident electromagnetic fields amplitude and phase as a function of time at a later time the action is reversed the quantum memories are read out in synchrony and the singlemode fibre outputs are allowed to interact consistent with the original observation in contrast to any classical memory device the write and read processes of a quantum memory are nondestructive and hence preserve the photonic quantum states in principle with sufficiently long storage times and sufficiently high photonic storage capacity quantum memories operating at widely separated telescopes can be brought together to achieve optical interferometry over arbitrarily long baselines,astro-ph

the luminosities of short gamma ray burst host galaxies are anticorrelated with both the isotropic equivalent gamma ray energy and the gamma ray luminosity of the explosions observational selection effects only strengthen the significance of this correlation the correlation may indicate that there are two physically distinct groups of sgrbs if so it requires that the more luminous class of explosions be associated with the younger class of progenitors alternatively it could be due to a continuous distribution of burst and host properties as one possible explanation we find that the effect of binary neutron star masses on inspiral time and energy reservoir produces a correlation of the appropriate sign but does not automatically reproduce the correlation slope or the full range of sgrb energy scales any future model of sgrb progenitors needs to reproduce this correlation,astro-ph

when a rubber tube with free ends is inflated under volume control the pressure will first reach a maximum and then decrease monotonically to approach a constant asymptote the pressure maximum corresponds to the initiation of a localised bulge and is predicted by a bifurcation condition whereas the asymptote is the maxwell pressure corresponding to a twophase propagation state in contrast when the tube is first prestretched and then has its ends fixed during subsequent inflation the pressure versus bulge amplitude has both a maximum and a minimum and the behaviour on the right ascending branch has previously not been fully understood we show that for all values of prestretch and tube length the ascending branches all converge to a single curve that is only dependent on the ratio of tube thickness to the outer radius this curve represents the maxwell state to be approached in each case if euler buckling or axisymmetric wrinkling does not occur first but this state is pressuredependent in contrast with the freeends case we also demonstrate experimentally that localized bulging cannot occur when the prestretch is sufficiently large and investigate what strainenergy functions can predict this observed phenomenon,cond-mat

fewshot segmentation aims at assigning a category label to each image pixel with few annotated samples it is a challenging task since the dense prediction can only be achieved under the guidance of latent features defined by sparse annotations existing metalearning method tends to fail in generating categoryspecifically discriminative descriptor when the visual features extracted from support images are marginalized in embedding space to address this issue this paper presents an adaptive tuning framework in which the distribution of latent features across different episodes is dynamically adjusted based on a selfsegmentation scheme augmenting categoryspecific descriptors for label prediction specifically a novel selfsupervised innerloop is firstly devised as the base learner to extract the underlying semantic features from the support image then gradient maps are calculated by backpropagating selfsupervised loss through the obtained features and leveraged as guidance for augmenting the corresponding elements in embedding space finally with the ability to continuously learn from different episodes an optimizationbased metalearner is adopted as outer loop of our proposed framework to gradually refine the segmentation results extensive experiments on benchmark pascali and cocoi datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over stateoftheart,cs
we present a machine learning method for the reconstruction of the undistorted images of background sources in strongly lensed systems this method treats the source as a pixelated image and utilizes the recurrent inference machine rim to iteratively reconstruct the background source given a lens model our architecture learns to minimize the likelihood of the model parameters source pixels given the data using the physical forward model ray tracing simulations while implicitly learning the prior of the source structure from the training data this results in better performance compared to linear inversion methods where the prior information is limited to the point covariance of the source pixels approximated with a gaussian form and often specified in a relatively arbitrary manner we combine our source reconstruction network with a convolutional neural network that predicts the parameters of the mass distribution in the lensing galaxies directly from telescope images allowing a fully automated reconstruction of the background source images and the foreground mass distribution,astro-ph

elementary trapping sets etss are the main culprits for the performance of ldpc codes in the error floor region due to the large quantity complex structures and computational difficulties of etss how to eliminate dominant etss in designing ldpc codes becomes a pivotal issue to improve the error floor behavior in practice researchers commonly address this problem by avoiding some special graph structures to free specific etss in tanner graph in this paper we deduce the accurate turan number of theta and prove that all abetss in tanner graph with variableregular degree d_lvgamma must satisfy the bound bgeq agammafraca which improves the lower bound obtained by amirzade when the girth is for the case of girth by limiting the relation between any two cycles in the tanner graph we prove a similar inequality bgeq agammafracasqrta the simulation results show that the designed codes have good performance with lower error floor over additive white gaussian noise channels,cs

recent work has raised concerns about the inherent limitations of textonly pretraining in this paper we first demonstrate that reporting bias the tendency of people to not state the obvious is one of the causes of this limitation and then investigate to what extent multimodal training can mitigate this issue to accomplish this we generate the color dataset coda a dataset of humanperceived color distributions for common objects use coda to analyze and compare the color distribution found in text the distribution captured by language models and a humans perception of color and investigate the performance differences between textonly and multimodal models on coda our results show that the distribution of colors that a language model recovers correlates more strongly with the inaccurate distribution found in text than with the groundtruth supporting the claim that reporting bias negatively impacts and inherently limits textonly training we then demonstrate that multimodal models can leverage their visual training to mitigate these effects providing a promising avenue for future research,cs

in mpetrovitch initiated the study of a class of entire functions all whose finite sections are realrooted polynomials an explicit description of this class in terms of the coefficients of a series is impossible since it is determined by an infinite number of discriminantal inequalities one for each degree however interesting necessary or sufficient conditions can be formulated in particular jihutchinson has shown that an entire function pxa_a_xa_nxn with strictly positive coefficients has the property that any its finite segment a_ixia_jxj has all real roots if and only if for all i one has a_ia_ia_i is greater than or equal to in the present paper we give sharp lower bounds on the ratios a_ia_ia_i for the class considered by mpetrovitch in particular we show that the limit of these minima when i tends to infinity equals the inverse of the maximal positive value of the parameter for which the classical partial theta function belongs to the laguerrepolya class,math
the giardinakurchanpeliti algorithm is a numerical procedure that uses population dynamics in order to calculate large deviation functions associated to the distribution of timeaveraged observables to study the numerical errors of this algorithm we explicitly devise a stochastic birthdeath process that describes the time evolution of the population probability from this formulation we derive that systematic errors of the algorithm decrease proportionally to the inverse of the population size based on this observation we propose a simple interpolation technique for the better estimation of large deviation functions the approach we present is detailed explicitly in a twostate model,cond-mat
the efficiency of photoconductive switches which continue to be used for the generation and detection of thz waves has been overlooked for a long time the so far opticsdominated devices are making their way through to new and emerging fields of research that require ultrafast picosecond voltage pulses as well as to new applications where power efficiency is of uttermost importance to address the efficiency problems in this article we present a novel photoconductive switch that is based on a dimensional design in contrast to conventional planar designs our photoconductive switch drastically enhances the overall efficiency by maximising the laser absorption within the device while at the same time optimising the carrier collection efficiency at the electrodes to maximise the optical absorption we take advantage of photonic and plasmonic modes that are excited in our device due to a periodic array of nanopillars whereas the collection efficiency is optimised by converting each nanopillar into a single nanophotoconductive switch our numerical calculations show a fold increase in the overall generated current and a fold bandwidth increase compared to traditional interdigitated planar photoconductive switches this opens up a wealth of new possibilities in quantum science and technology where efficient low power devices are indispensable,physics

reinforcement learning has achieved great success in various applications to learn an effective policy for the agent it usually requires a huge amount of data by interacting with the environment which could be computational costly and time consuming to overcome this challenge the framework called reinforcement learning with expert demonstrations rled was proposed to exploit the supervision from expert demonstrations although the rled methods can reduce the number of learning iterations they usually assume the demonstrations are perfect and thus may be seriously misled by the noisy demonstrations in real applications in this paper we propose a novel framework to adaptively learn the policy by jointly interacting with the environment and exploiting the expert demonstrations specifically for each step of the demonstration trajectory we form an instance and define a joint loss function to simultaneously maximize the expected reward and minimize the difference between agent behaviors and demonstrations most importantly by calculating the expected gain of the value function we assign each instance with a weight to estimate its potential utility and thus can emphasize the more helpful demonstrations while filter out noisy ones experimental results in various environments with multiple popular reinforcement learning algorithms show that the proposed approach can learn robustly with noisy demonstrations and achieve higher performance in fewer iterations,cs

deuterium plays a crucial role in cosmology because the primordial dh abundance in the context of big bang nucleosynthesis bbn theory yields a precise measure of the cosmic baryon content observations of dh can limit or measure the true primordial abundance because d is thought to be destroyed by stars and thus dh monotonically decreases after bbn recently however mullan linsky have pointed out that d arises as a secondary product of neutrons in stellar flares which then capture on protons via np to d gamma and that this could dominate over direct d production in flares mullan linsky note that if this process is sufficiently vigorous in flaring dwarf stars it could lead to significant nonbbn d production we have considered the production of d in stellar flares both directly and by n capture we find that for reasonable flare spectra nd and ndli both of which indicate that the ncapture channel does not allow for galactic d production at a level which will reverse the monotonic decline of d we also calculate the mev gammaray line production associated with n capture and find that existing comptel limits also rule out significant d production in the galaxy today thus we find flares in particular and neutron captures in general are not an important galactic source of d on the other hand we cannot exclude that flare production might contribute to recent fuse observations of large variations in the local interstellar dh abundance we do however offer important constraints on this possibility finally since flare stars should inevitably produce some ncapture events a search for diffuse mev gammarays by integral can further constrain or measure galactic deuterium production via ncapture,astro-ph
we formulate a generic concept of engineering optical modes and mechanical resonances in a pair of opticallycoupled lightguiding membranes for achieving cascaded light scattering to multiple stokes and antistokes orders by utilizing the light pressure exerted on the webs and their induced flexural vibrations featuring flat phonon dispersion curve with a nonzero cutoff frequency we show how to realize exact phasematching between multiple successive optical sidebands we predict continuouswave generation of frequency combs for fundamental and highorder optical modes mediated via backward and forwardpropagating phonons accompanied by periodic reversal of the energy flow between mechanical and optical modes without using any kind of cavity these results reveal new possibilities for tailoring lightsound interactions through simultaneous ramanlike intramodal and brillouinlike intermodal scattering processes,physics
in this paper we present a preliminary version of the accompanion an expressive accompaniment system for midi input the system uses a probabilistic monophonic score follower to track the position of the soloist in the score and a linear gaussian model to compute tempo updates the expressiveness of the system is powered by the basismixer a stateoftheart computational model of expressive music performance the system allows for expressive dynamics timing and articulation,cs
we use reanalysis data to investigate the daily covariability of wind and solar irradiance in britain and its implications for renewable energy supply balancing the joint distribution of dailymean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind due to the rotational tilt of the earth irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year lesssim rho lesssim there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier this is particularly true in atlanticfacing regions western scotland southwest england the east coast of britain has the weakest anticorrelation particularly in winter primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clearbutwindy days we also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels in all months daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity the scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately solar to wind this work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on longterm average relationships or correlations in particular the anticorrelation between wind and solar power in britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a wellbalanced energy supply,physics
in this work we propose a novel framework for estimating the dimension of the data manifold using a trained diffusion model a diffusion model approximates the score function ie the gradient of the log density of a noisecorrupted version of the target distribution for varying levels of corruption we prove that if the data concentrates around a manifold embedded in the highdimensional ambient space then as the level of corruption decreases the score function points towards the manifold as this direction becomes the direction of maximal likelihood increase therefore for small levels of corruption the diffusion model provides us with access to an approximation of the normal bundle of the data manifold this allows us to estimate the dimension of the tangent space thus the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold to the best of our knowledge our method is the first estimator of the data manifold dimension based on diffusion models and it outperforms well established statistical estimators in controlled experiments on both euclidean and image data,cs
we characterize three notions of explainable ai that cut across research fields opaque systems that offer no insight into its algo rithmic mechanisms interpretable systems where users can mathemat ically analyze its algorithmic mechanisms and comprehensible systems that emit symbols enabling userdriven explanations of how a conclusion is reached the paper is motivated by a corpus analysis of nips acl cogsci and iccveccv paper titles showing differences in how work on explainable ai is positioned in various fields we close by introducing a fourth notion truly explainable systems where automated reasoning is central to output crafted explanations without requiring human post processing as final step of the generative process,cs
we present a model for multiwavelength mixing in semiconductor optical amplifiers soas based on coupledmode equations the proposed model applies to all kinds of soa structures takes into account the longitudinal dependence of carrier density caused by saturation it accommodates an arbitrary functional dependencies of the material gain and carrier recombination rate on the local value of carrier density and is computationally more efficient by orders of magnitude as compared with the standard full model based on spacetime equations we apply the coupledmode equations model to a recently demonstrated phasesensitive amplifier based on an integrated soa and prove its results to be consistent with the experimental data the accuracy of the proposed model is certified by means of a meticulous comparison with the results obtained by integrating the spacetime equations,physics
